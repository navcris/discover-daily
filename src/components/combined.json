            "They call it the Doomsday Glacier. A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geo-engineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",
            "BQGlaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century.",
            "Meanwhile, some of his collaborators, fearing the logistical complications of such a task, are pondering an even more mind-bending idea. They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",
            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",
            "Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster \u2013 a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica\u201d \u2014 should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "fC\nEuropean Space Agency / Adapted by Yale Environment 360",
            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as seven feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "Last month, Moore and an international team of researchers published a \u201cresearch vision\u201d for \u201cglacial climate intervention.\u201d It followed workshops held last year at Stanford and the University of Chicago with fellow glaciologists, and it warned that if tipping points at the two glaciers have or will soon be crossed, then whatever happens to greenhouse gas emissions in the future \u201cwill have little effect on preserving the ice sheet.\u201d\n",
            "Ice-sheet modeling last year by Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey concurred. \u201cThe opportunity to preserve the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in its present-day state has probably passed,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand policymakers should be prepared for several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.\u201d",
            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geo-engineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",
            "BQSome experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean.",
            "Moore wants to get started on testing the idea, and he and his collaborators are seeking research funding. The first experiments in a large lab tank are expected to begin within a few weeks at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, whose mission is to advance \u201cclimate repair projects that can be rolled out at scale within the next 5-10 years.\u201d",
            "Real-world experiments could follow quickly, says Moore. \u201cWithin two years, we could be working at a fjord in northern Norway, testing different designs in a marine setting.\u201d He has identified a target fjord but won\u2019t say where. \u201cIf that goes well, we would want to scale up to a curtain as much as a kilometer across.\u201d He envisions this being tested among the glaciers of Svalbard, the Norwegian Arctic archipelago that has become an international center for polar research. \u201cIn 10-15 years, we should have something to deploy in Antarctica,\u201d he says.",
            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. Much could be accomplished with a curtain just three miles wide stretching across a \u201cchoke point\u201d in front of the most vulnerable part of the Thwaites Glacier.",

            "Hugh Hunt, an engineering professor and deputy director of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, has another proposal. \u201cWe have been looking for ideas that involve less infrastructure,\u201d he says. The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "Her Colorado colleague and Thwaites Glacier expert Scambos is more open to geo-engineering research, but still skeptical. \u201cI think the ideas are worth pursuing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could explore them at a meaningfully large scale in sites with low negative consequences if things don\u2019t go well.\u201d But, like Moon, he fears the impact on climate policymaking.\n",
            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that. Climate negotiators at the UN COP28 meeting last December \u201cbrought up the notion that decarbonizing could go slower now that these [geo-engineering] ideas are out there,\u201d Scambos says. \u201cThe idea that \u2018scientists are working on the problem\u2019 could be a death knell for the 22nd century.\u201d",
            "Moore has heard these criticisms. \u201cYes, there is opposition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to address that. We need a social licence.\u201d He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",
            "If the glaciers are past their tipping points, dooming the world\u2019s coastal lands, he says, we may have no alternative but to bite the geo-engineering bullet. And the sooner we get started, he says, the better."

            "In 2011, Philadelphia\u2019s city-owned water utility drew national attention when it began Green City, Clean Waters, a 25-year program to manage an increasing volume of stormwater by using mostly \u201cgreen infrastructure,\u201d such as rain gardens and porous pavements, which allows rain to soak into the ground rather than becoming runoff that pollutes rivers and creeks.",
            "With a plan for green infrastructure to drain some 9,500 acres across the city, the Philadelphia Water Department was considered by many to be at the cutting edge of stormwater management \u2014 an increasingly urgent challenge for city governments amid the bigger, more frequent rainstorms now occurring as a result of climate change, especially in the northeastern United States.\n",
            "The program led Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to install nature-based solutions to absorb and filter rainfall alongside traditional \u201cgray infrastructure,\u201d such as pipes, tunnels, and pump stations. Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales \u2014 vegetated ditches that collect stormwater \u2014 at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began.\n",
            "BQGray infrastructure can take decades to implement and cost billions of dollars, but many cities don\u2019t have much of a choice.",
            "An average of 14 billion gallons of polluted stormwater have overflowed from Philadelphia\u2019s 164 sewage outfall pipes each year since Green City, Clean Waters began, according to \u201cUnraveling the Facts\u201d a new report from the Restore the River Advocacy Team, a group of water experts and environmentalists that includes the former heads of the interstate Delaware River Basin Commission and the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority, which manages wastewater in the southern New Jersey county.",

            "Roughly 700 municipalities in the U.S. rely on combined sewer systems, mostly in the Northeast and around the Great Lakes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These cities and towns are taking a hard look at updated climate projections that show an increase in heavy rainfall, and many are doubling down on gray infrastructure projects, which include concrete holding tanks, tunnels, and pipes that can divert and hold onto combined flows until the rain stops and treatment plants recover. Such projects can take decades to implement and cost billions of dollars \u2014 green infrastructure is both cheaper and faster to build \u2014 but many cities are finding they don\u2019t have much of a choice.",

            "In Milwaukee, the Metropolitan Sewerage District, which serves 1.1 million people, relies on both green and gray infrastructure. But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district\u2019s executive director. He estimated that the system\u2019s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch.",
            "Still, he calls green infrastructure \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d because managing water where it falls protects water bodies from contaminants like bacteria, heavy metals, and trash, and it reduces the risk of basement backups. \u201cYou have to have both,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee\u2019s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. \u201cWith the changing climate we\u2019re facing,\u201d Shafer has said, \u201cit\u2019s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.\u201d\n",
            "Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",
            "BQAlexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "But according to Max Rome, stormwater program manager for the nonprofit Charles River Watershed Association, the control plan\u2019s current goal may be impossible to meet. In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",
            "Increased rainfall is also affecting Western cities, including Portland, Oregon, which sharply reduced pollution in the downtown section of the Willamette River and Columbia Slough by building three tunnels to hold stormwater flows.

            "The 2.2-mile-long tunnel, completed at a cost of $615 million but not due to begin operating until early 2026, will reduce sewage and stormwater overflows into the Potomac River from 140 million gallons a year, between 2000 and 2016, to 17 million gallons a year, said Justin Carl, chief executive of AlexRenew, the city\u2019s public wastewater treatment authority. Alexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "The project includes some green infrastructure, like bioretention basins and tree wells that filter and retain stormwater runoff. But the agency decided to limit those measures because most of its CSOs occur in the oldest part of the city, which has little open space and clayey soils, which have a slow infiltration rate when moist.",
            "BQOnly one site in Washington was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow and wasn\u2019t densely developed.",
            "A much larger stormwater project is planned for the nation\u2019s capital, where DC Water, an independent local-government authority, is building an 18-mile network of tunnels to hold 249 million gallons of stormwater and sewage until it can be safely pumped to a treatment plant. When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",
            "Green infrastructure is just a small part of the overall project, costing $98 million out of a total budget of $3.29 billion, Wone said. The agency conducted green-infrastructure pilot projects at two sites and concluded that only one, in Rock Creek Park, was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow volumes and wasn\u2019t densely developed.\n",

But once I got to the Mackenzie, which is part of the second longest river system on the continent, I had to make way for tugboats pulling giant barges filled with gas, heating fuel, dry food, and other supplies destined for roadless Indigenous communities downstream of the village of Wrigley, where the Mackenzie Highway, which begins in Alberta, ends. More than once on a cold misty night, I was awoken in my tent by the deafening blast of a tug\u2019s horn.",
            "Nowadays, those horn blasts are far less frequent because the Mackenzie River, which flows northwest to the Arctic Ocean and is part of the second longest river system on the continent, is at times not deep enough to float those barges. In fact, the government-owned company that operates the tugs stopped service altogether this year when it became clear the river would not contain sufficient water \u2014 even in late spring, after river ice melted. In June, the Canadian Coast Guard announced its services, including the provision of on-the-water responses and maintenance of aids to navigation, were \u201cimpacted\u201d for almost a thousand miles of river.\n",
            "With fresh and dried food, essential building supplies, and fuel now being flown in by plane, and prices skyrocketing, residents in the five communities in the Sahtu region are ramping up their demand for the Canadian government to build a $1 billion (Canadian) road and bridge \u2014 known as the Mackenzie Valley Highway project \u2014 that will serve as a lifeline and connect them with other communities and services in the south. Many are currently rationing fuel and bringing in food from the south while vacationing or undergoing medical exams and treatment.\n",
            "BQThe Mackenize River has never been so low, and all signs suggest climate change will make the situation much worse. ",
            "During earlier periods of low water, supplies were trucked north thousands of miles from the south along the Alaksa and Dempster highways, then barged in from the Arctic Ocean on the Mackenzie. But this workaround has never happened with water so low for so long, and all signs suggest climate change will make the situation much worse.",
            "\u201cThe big issue for people living up here is what is next year \u2014 and the years after that \u2014 going to bring as the climate continues to warm and dry out the river?\u201d says Todd McCauley, who is leading the campaign for the road that his mother, a Dene Indigenous chief, advocated for many years ago.",
            "\u201cIf you look at the bay on the Mackenzie where the barges [from the Arctic Ocean] dock at Norman Wells, there\u2019s no water. It\u2019s nothing but mud.\u201d",
            "\u201cFor a very long time, the North has been viewed as a source of resources \u2014 beaver, furs, timber, metals, oil and gas \u2014 all to be developed by southern companies, financed by southern banks, for the benefit of distant southern markets,\u201d says Charles McNeely, a Fort Good Hope resident who is chairman of the Dene- and Metis-run Sahtu Secretariat, which is responsible for implementing a range of services for the region\u2019s five communities.\n",
            "\u201cIn exchange for this, the North got dispossessed of our lands and resources, our families torn apart [by the residential school program], our culture and language discredited, and our children abused. Not exactly a fair exchange, was it? How about we try something different for a change?\u201d\n",

            "Increasingly hot, dry weather, diminishing winter snowpack, and rapidly melting icefields have been reducing mid- to later-summer flows along most of the continent\u2019s Arctic rivers for many years. While I was boating down the Alaska side of the Yukon River with retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist Skip Ambrose this past June, he told me that he had never seen such low river levels over the 50 years he\u2019s been surveying peregrine falcon nest sites there. The Great Slave Lake, the fifth largest lake in North America, which drains into the Mackenzie River, is also at a record low.",
            "But people living along the Yukon and Mackenzie rivers aren\u2019t only dealing with the stresses of low water. High water levels, the result of melting far earlier in the year, are also causing disruptions. In 2021, flooding in the Hay, Mackenzie, and Little Buffalo river systems caused $40 million in damages. In 2023, rising water levels along the Yukon River at Eagle, Alaska, poured onto the streets and into a hotel.\n",
            "University of Saskatchewan water expert John Pomeroy suggests that northerners should brace themselves for the bigger rainstorms that climate change is bringing. Climate change is also accelerating the recession of glaciers and thawing permafrost and snowpacks earlier and in shorter bursts.",
            "\u201cWhat we expect to see is much higher and earlier flows, higher flood peaks, and less water flowing in the hot days of summer,\u201d he says, warning of severe consequences for water resources management and navigation.\n",
            "BQConservationists worry that saying yes to the road will bolster the claims of other interests lobbying for roads in the Arctic.",
            "Pomeroy\u2019s observation has been echoed by other studies, including one that recently calculated the stream flow in 486,493 pan-Arctic river reaches from 1984 to 2018. The scientists found significant changes in the rate and timing of river discharges during the spring melt of snow and ice and in summer stream intermittency.",
            "Scientists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst recently combined field observations and numerical modeling to determine how 8.7 million square miles of the Arctic are likely to change over the next 80 years. They suggest that by 2100 there will be 25 percent more runoff in the far north from subsurface pathways and more rainfall, but less water flowing in late spring and summer.",
            "Yukon glaciers sliding out of the St. Elias icefield, among the most expansive in the world, have lost 22 percent of their surface area since 1958. The Brintnell Bologna Icefields in the Ragged Range of the Northwest Territories, which sends meltwater into the Mackenzie River system, are fading even faster.",

            "For years, residents of the Sahtu have been demanding from the Canadian government a two-lane gravel highway of approximately 200 miles. The road was estimated to cost at least $700 million, and in 2018 the government allocated approximately $70 million to study its feasibility. But last February, Canada\u2019s Environment Minister announced the government would no longer invest in major, new road construction. Money spent on asphalt and concrete, minister Steven Guilbeault said, would be \u201cbetter invested into projects that will help fight climate change and adapt to its impacts.\u201d",
            "After a public outcry, Northwest Territory\u2019s member of parliament, Michael McLeod, quickly clarified that the Mackenzie Valley Highway was still on the table, as did Guilbeault.",
            "Still, conservationists worry that saying yes to the road will bolster the claims of other communities and mining interests that have been lobbying for roads in other regions of the Arctic. For example, mining companies and the Inuit in the Kitikmeot region of the central Arctic have pushed \u2014 unsuccessfully so far \u2014 for a port to be constructed along the Arctic coast with a road running from Bathurst Inlet to a complex of inland mines and mining exploration sites.",
            "Earlier this year, Nunavut, Canada\u2019s self-governing Inuit territory, hired an engineering company to study the potential for a 450-mile road that would connect four western Hudson Bay communities. A separate 200-mile route to the more remote inland community of Baker Lake is also under consideration. Neither of these roads, nor the Mackenzie Valley Highway, could be built without significant federal funding.",
            "To understand why the federal government may be reluctant to fund Arctic roads, it\u2019s helpful to understand the fate of other northern highways and what a rapidly warming Arctic will mean for such infrastructure.",
            "BQThe people of the Sahtu have invested more in conservation and carbon capture than has any jurisdiction in the south.",
            "Opened to the public in 2017, the $300 million, 87-mile all-weather road from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk in Northwest Territories was supposed to bring tourists to the Inuvialuit town of Tuktoyaktuk and lower the cost of energy development along the Arctic coast. But few tourists undertake the long, punishing drive, and the oil and gas companies pulled out of the region before the road was even completed. Today, Tuktoyaktuk is slowly sliding into the sea due to rising sea levels, powerful storms surges, and rapidly thawing permafrost.",
            "Maintaining Arctic roads has also proved costly. Just a few years after the Inuvik to Tuk highway was completed, the government spent an additional $13.5 million to raise it in areas where permafrost had thawed. Climate-related maintenance costs for the Yukon\u2019s highway network have risen by $169,000 per year, in constant 2021 dollars, since 1994.\n",
            "The Mackenzie Valley Highway is not likely to cause as many headaches, according to University of Alberta scientist Duane Froese, who has been conducting permafrost research in the Sahtu region for the past few years\n",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s less permafrost and less ice-rich permafrost in comparison to the Inuvik to Tuk Highway,\u201d he says. \u201cMuch of the route is along till plains that are unlikely in that region to host significant ground ice.\u201d",

            "Conservation groups have been silent on this issue for a few reasons. First, the right-of-way for the Mackenzie road does not pass through critical wildlife corridors, as the Bathurst Inlet road would. Second, they don\u2019t want to jeopardize their relationship with people of the western Arctic, as there is still much wilderness to protect there, and they need the Dene on their side as partners, as the Dene own and have rights to vast areas of land.\n",
            "The people of the Sahtu have already invested more in conservation and carbon capture than has any jurisdiction in the south. They agreed to allow a new national park \u2014 N\u00e1\u00e1ts\u2019ihch\u2019oh \u2014 established on their territory. And organizations such as the Boreal Songbird Initiative and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society have praised them for recently agreeing to protect 4,000 square miles of carbon-rich wetlands along the Ramparts River near Fort Good Hope.\n",
            "The Sahtu hope that the road will make it easier and cheaper to receive essential goods. But they also foresee economic opportunity, hoping that tourists, climbers, hikers, and paddlers travel to the new park and the region\u2019s pristine mountain and tundra rivers.",
            "Road proponents like McCauley point to other reasons for building. A road would make it easier to clean up the piles of scrap metals, broken down vehicles, leaking batteries, and other toxic materials from mining and other development activity that have been accumulating in Indigenous communities along the Mackenzie, and in Inuit communities on the Arctic islands, for decades.",
            "\u201cThe first two roads\u201d \u2014 the Dempster Highway and the Inuvik to Tuk road \u2014 \u201cwere built to take resources out of the North,\u201d says McNeely, of the Sahtu Secretariat.

            "Field biologists tend to be a patient lot, often resigned to long days and weeks in the field and committed to experiments that take years to yield results. But even among that dogged crowd, Martin Wikelski stands out.\n",
            "Back in 2001, sitting on a porch one evening in Panama, the German ornithologist had the germ of an idea for an \u201cinternet of animals,\u201d a global system of sensor-wearing wildlife that would reveal the planet\u2019s elusive, nonhuman worlds. He figured he could get it up and running by 2005. Nearly 20 years later, Wikelski may have finally succeeded \u2014 after surmounting roadblocks that range from bureaucratic mishaps to technical glitches to a geopolitical crisis. His space-based system, known as ICARUS (International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space), is now scheduled to launch, in its latest, satellite-based incarnation, on a private rocket sometime in 2025.\n",
            "The underlying idea of the internet of animals is to tune into the planet\u2019s hidden phenomena \u2014 the flight paths followed by sharp-shinned hawks, the precise fates befalling Arctic terns that die young, the exact landscape requirements of critically endangered saiga antelope \u2014 by attaching tiny, solar-powered tracking devices, some weighing less than a paperclip, to all kinds of organisms and even some inanimate objects (glaciers, ocean plastic debris). The inexpensive, globe-spanning system of animal tagging is meant to help scientists understand the precise drivers of global change, and much more, by tracking thousands of tagged animals from space and tying their experiences to the broader impacts facing whole populations or even species.",
            "BQBeginning sometime next year, the ICARUS project plans to launch receivers on five low-cost miniature satellites.",
            "Wikelski, the director of the Department of Migration at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, in Germany, said the prospect of having that data, and of \u201cmaking people aware of the incredible beauty and richness of what\u2019s happening out there,\u201d has made the effort worthwhile, even urgent. It\u2019s also true, as he wrote in his recent book The Internet of Animals: Discovering the Collective Intelligence of Life on Earth, that he \u201chad no clue how many pitfalls there would be\u2026 how many times when we desperately wanted to give up, because the whole process had become so exquisitely frustrating that we just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d",
            "In 2018, after years of working with designers, engineers, and government officials from multiple countries and continents, Wikelski\u2019s team saw its ICARUS receiver launch aboard a Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station, where Russian cosmonauts attached it to their side of the orbiting lab. \u201cWe danced, cried, and hugged one another,\u201d Wikelski wrote of the launch. \u201cAll the stress of nearly 20 years fell away.\u201d",
            "The internet of animals went live in March 2020, but before the year was out, mechanical issues on the Russian ISS module took the system down. Nearly a year passed before it was up and running again. By the spring of 2021, the system was finally humming along, receiving data from roughly 3,500 tagged animals around the world. But then, in the winter of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, and the West cut ties with Russia. ICARUS\u2019s transmission of data abruptly halted.\n",

            "After the ISS failure, Wikelski\u2019s team set out to redesign the system to use satellite-based receivers, which had always been its long-term aim. In 2022, plans seemed almost set for an ICARUS receiver to orbit on the next GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite, a joint venture between NASA and the German space agency, scheduled to launch in 2028. But last-minute political haggling siphoned more than a third of the project\u2019s German funding, leaving no money to include ICARUS. \u201cWe were totally devastated,\u201d Wikelski recalled. He gave his project three months to find a solution or finally give up. \u201cThat\u2019s when we scaled down and said, we need a CubeSat.\u201d",
            "And so beginning sometime next year, the project plans to launch ICARUS receivers on five relatively low-cost CubeSats \u2014 miniature satellites roughly the size of a Rubik\u2019s cube and weighing only a couple of pounds \u2014 using private launch companies. Funded by the Max Planck Society, the system will cost roughly $1.57 million to launch and have annual operating expenses of around $160,000.\n",
            "\u201cThe geopolitical aspect of this is pretty huge,\u201d said Michael Wunder, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Colorado Denver who used the ISS tags to study the migration patterns of mountain plovers before the war in Ukraine cut off the research. Instead of involving government space agencies, the project\u2019s new iteration keeps the scientists in control.\n",
            "BQTiny tags record animals\u2019 movements and body temperature, as well as air temperature, air pressure, and wind speed.",
            "The new system allows for greater global coverage \u2014 the ISS receiver couldn\u2019t communicate with tags at the planet\u2019s highest latitudes \u2014 and Wikelski\u2019s team has used the intervening years to shrink the tags by several grams and design new ways for animals to \u201cwear\u201d them, vastly expanding the number of species scientists can study. The team is currently upgrading 4,000 older tags to work with the new system. The tags provide hourly accounts of the animal\u2019s energy expenditure; measure environmental factors like air pressure, altitude, temperature, and humidity; and even use AI to help interpret the animal\u2019s behavior.",
            "The trove of data \u201cwill open a lot of doors for researchers,\u201d said Ashley Lohr, who coordinates North American projects for ICARUS through the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. \u201cHow stressed was the animal? What were the environmental conditions when the animal was at this place at this time?\u201d\n",
            "Wunder\u2019s lab group tagged 17 mountain plovers in Colorado in 2021. Native to the plains of the north-central United Staes, the species has declined by 80 percent in the past six decades. But the birds are hard to study because of their habitat and behavior. \u201cThey\u2019re singing and vociferous but not in your face,\u201d Wunder said, and in breeding season they like their space, living in densities of only about three birds per square kilometer. The plovers often occupy private ranchlands, which makes them hard to find without trespassing. And they breed in late March and April, while bird surveys, timed to count migratory songbirds, happen in May.\n",

            "fCBiologist Martin Wikelski tags a scarlet macaw with an ICARUS transmitter.\nCourtesy of Martin Wikelski",
            "Wunder has long sought to understand whether mountain plovers follow distinct, structured migration patterns or whether birds from different areas mix together in winter flocks. He also wants to learn what drives the birds to migrate. \u201cAre they moving away from something or toward something else?\u201d he asks. He also hopes to determine exactly where the birds are running into trouble.",
            "Before the ISS receiver went dark in 2022, the ICARUS tags revealed that the plovers didn\u2019t follow fixed migration routes and that birds from around the country were mingling in the winter. When several transmitting birds died, Wunder was able to dispatch researchers to their locations and discover the cause of death \u2014 predation. The birds started returning to Colorado in February, and Wunder was eager to see which ones would come back \u2014 but then the war in Ukraine began. \u201cWe were cut off, there was no more information,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Ellen Aikens, a biologist at the University of Wyoming who did her postdoctoral research on animal migration at the Max Planck Institute, believes that ICARUS could serve as a \u201cdemocratizing force\u201d in ecology and biology. It\u2019s a way to level the playing field, she says, so that \u201cfolks that have a smaller budget or are working on species that are a bit more obscure and there\u2019s not as much funding behind can start to get the same kind of information, baseline info, about where those [animals] are going.\u201d\n",
            "BQAs animals travel, says one expert, they can collect environmental information that can better inform climate models.",
            "In her lab, Aikens is studying golden eagles using a tag made by the German company e-obs. \u201cIt\u2019s the gold standard of biologging in bird research, if you can afford it and your bird is big enough to carry the transformer\u201d \u2014 like geese, storks, and eagles. A single e-obs tag costs more than $1,500 and works over a cellular network, meaning researchers must also pay the cost of data transmission for as long as the animal lives. \u201cIf you want to get a good sample size that will allow you to publish your research, that adds up really quickly,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cICARUS tags are cheaper by an order of magnitude.\u201d",
            "Aikens believes that ICARUS will help transform the way scientists study animals. Our nonhuman neighbors \u201ccan take a pulse of the planet and be detectors of change and help us understand the health of the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cAs [animals] move these vast distances, they can collect detailed environmental information that can better inform climate models and collect information in places that are difficult to monitor,\u201d whether high in the sky, deep in the ocean, or under a thick layer of ice.",
            "ICARUS tags are solar-powered, whereas some existing tagging systems run on batteries, which can die \u2014 ending the research on that individual or requiring recapture to change them out. Other tagging systems rely on animals passing by a signal tower. It works for certain animals, like birds and bats, but not for others. \u201cBecause ICARUS is satellite-powered, you don\u2019t have to wait for your animal to go back on the grid and pass by a tower,\u201d said Lohr. Instead, each time a satellite passes over an area, data from nearby tagged animals will be uploaded to Movebank, an open-access database.",

            "Ultimately, researchers hope that ICARUS data can \u201chelp us pinpoint effective conservation strategies,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cIt can help us identify pinch points on the landscape.\u201d While this is already happening for some species, including North American ungulates like elk and pronghorn antelope, whose migrations researchers have tracked for years, for most of the planet\u2019s species \u201cwe lack this data and this wide coverage of information, which makes these fine-scale interventions a lot harder to achieve. That\u2019s a place that ICARUS can help fill in a lot of gaps.\u201d\n",
            "And if the internet of animals can zero in on specific issues \u2014 for instance, a bird species dying out because a particular insect it eats is being killed by a particular chemical being sprayed in an area \u2014 Wikelski believes such information could drive people to act. \u201cPeople are willing to do something about it if they know that what they do is really helpful,\u201d he said.\n",
            "For now, Wikelski continues to practice patience. When I spoke to him in early July, he was dealing with the latest hurdle: satellite launch delays, including one caused by a payload issue and another caused by an ill-timed summer holiday that delayed authorization of the $30,000 payment needed to secure a launch reservation. \u201cOur project is now too small to really be on everybody\u2019s horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, it was too large.\u201d",
            "Nevertheless, Wikelski was hopeful. His team was studying and perfecting the lowest-stress methods of tagging animals and even testing automatic tagging systems, like one for deer involving a salt lick and a tiny elastic band. He remained confident of ICARUS\u2019s potential.",
            "\u201cOne really important aspect we think is transformative in biology is the scaling up of tagging,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have one animal but 50 or 100, or you do it across a continent.\u201d Over the next two years he plans to tag 9,000 animals in Europe, including blackbirds, storm thrushes, swifts, and sparrows in a study already underway. Roughly 7,000 of those 9,000 would die in the first year, he said, based on general patterns. \u201cThat means we are finally understanding where they disappear. Where are the death traps? These tags are so smart, they can tell us if a female is nesting and if the clutch disappears. So we can not only get information on where the adults are living and dying, but have the adults been successful in hatching or clutching? Is there a massive problem in a certain area? Then we can link individuals to populations and understand the drivers of change.\u201d"

            "The CDC\u2019s estimate of heat deaths, about 1,200 Americans a year, is probably at least a tenfold undercount. An estimate from several years ago was that, in the U.S., there are actually in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 heat-related deaths, and that is likely higher today.",
            "e360: Why is there such a gap between the actual number of excess deaths and the numbers that are attributed to heat?\n",
            "Ebi: Think of two people going into an emergency department with a heart attack. One was pushed over the edge into the heart attack because of the heat. The other was not. There\u2019s not a way to tell at the individual level, in the middle of a crisis, which heart attack could have been exacerbated by the heat and which was not. In both cases, the cause of death will be recorded as a heart attack.\n",
            "But we can tell at the population level. As with COVID, you look at the number of deaths during a particular time period, compare it with earlier time periods when there wasn\u2019t an epidemic, when there wasn\u2019t a heat wave, and that gives you a relatively accurate count of excess deaths. But again, at the individual level, making that attribution is pretty challenging.\n",
            "BQ\u201cHeat is a silent killer\u2026 Often the first sign people are in trouble is they get confused and can\u2019t always judge what is happening.\u201d",
            "e360: So it\u2019s more accurate to look at the excess deaths for a period than to look at, say, what a doctor writes on the death certificate?",
            "Ebi: That\u2019s correct. Because the focus of the emergency department has to be on trying to save that life, and you don\u2019t really want to change that dynamic. But there\u2019s also people who die from kidney causes, from respiratory causes, from a range of other issues, and parsing out how heat contributed to those illnesses is challenging at the individual level. But at the population level it\u2019s relatively straightforward.",
            "e360: Over the past several months the Federation of American Scientists, which works to minimize the risks of significant global threats, including climate change, has made several statements calling for the adoption of a standard methodology to measure heat deaths. Would that help?",
            "Ebi: The CDC is actively considering doing this because they are acutely aware that current estimates of heat-related mortality significantly underestimate the burden. The goals of understanding the numbers of deaths from heat include raising awareness and ensuring that the level of investment reflects the magnitude of the problem.\n",
            "While it would be desirable to have precision, there are tradeoffs in achieving it. Investigating all deaths during a heat wave to determine which were associated with heat requires resources and time, which would take away from other priority health issues.\n",

            "Ebi: We do have studies looking at the numbers of excess deaths, and they are increasing with climate change in some places but not in others because people are adapting to those changes. And of course, communities are adapting to those changes by implementing early warning systems, putting in cooling shelters, and by making other changes to try and protect the population.",
            "e360: Do we know what percentage of heat deaths is actually due to climate change?",
            "Ebi: There is abundant evidence that heat waves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration. There was a big modeling study that came out a couple of years ago, it looked at 43 countries, and the answer was, on average, 37 percent of heat-related summer mortality over the last several decades was due to climate change across those countries.\n",
            "e360: You\u2019ve said elsewhere that people don\u2019t think of heat as something that they should be worried about. But what you just said suggests this may be changing, that people are becoming more aware of the dangers of heat than they were a few years ago.\n",
            "Ebi: And thank you to the media for covering this story and helping people to understand that indeed they are at risk. Heat is a silent killer. Some early warning signs of heat stress are nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. But it can be challenging, because often the first sign that people are in trouble is they get confused and can\u2019t always judge for themselves what is happening. It means that all of us need to pay attention to family, friends, and colleagues to make sure that they\u2019re doing okay when the temperatures are high.",

            "Ebi: It goes back to your core body temperature and how that temperature affects your cells and your organs. It\u2019s not instantaneous. It does take a while for the cells and the organs to start reacting to the high temperature. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s 24 hours after the start of a heat wave when you start seeing the impacts.",
            "e360: We\u2019ve been talking mostly about the U.S., but in large parts of the world, heat is getting to levels that are threatening to any human life outside. Are there whole countries that are going to be entering the unlivable zone pretty soon?\n",
            "Ebi: I think it\u2019s important to step back and recognize that those deaths are preventable, that people don\u2019t need to die in the heat. This emphasis on whether it\u2019s going to be livable doesn\u2019t take into account the creativity of human beings. We live in all kinds of environments that are not livable. People live in Antarctica for several months a year. Humans have found ways to modify infrastructure, to modify clothing, behavioral patterns, to be able to survive in very extreme conditions. Our emissions of greenhouse gases are making it more complicated, of course. And so putting the emphasis on how we can prevent those deaths is, from my perspective, a priority.",

            "Ebi: We need to develop heat action plans with two major components. One is heat-wave early warning and response systems, with the emphasis on the response. It\u2019s not just telling people it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s telling them what they can do about it and ensuring they have access to services, making sure that there are cooling shelters, making sure that there\u2019s outreach to the unhoused, making sure that your outdoor workers are protected, that people living in elderly care institutions have access to cooling.\n",
            "The other part of a heat action plan is the long-term planning. What are our cities going to look like in 30 to 50 years? Will everybody be required to have a white roof? Will buildings over a certain size be required to have a green roof? Are we planting the trees that will cool our neighborhoods and that are going to survive in a hotter future?",
            "e360: So you\u2019re hopeful?\n",

            "On July 3, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a plan to start killing 15,000 barred owls a year in the Pacific Northwest, starting as soon as this fall. This extraordinary initiative \u2014 more than a dozen years in the making \u2014 is intended to save the imperiled northern spotted owl from extinction.\n",
            "Barred owls have been moving west into spotted owl territory for decades, aggressively outcompeting them for prey and nesting sites. If its plan is adopted, the federal agency will soon launch what\u2019s expected to be a three-decade campaign in which certified hunters will eventually shoot nearly half a million barred owls.\n",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re wildlife conservation professionals, and we don\u2019t take this lightly,\u201d said Bridget Moran, a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Bend, Oregon, who has been working on the strategy. \u201cThe spotted owl is at a crossroads. We have the science to indicate what we can do to conserve spotted owls, and [it\u2019s] telling us that we must manage barred owls in addition to habitat to save them.\u201d\n",
            "The plan, as presented in a final environmental impact statement, has garnered opposition, largely from animal welfare and anti-hunting groups, but also support from mainstream environmental groups. ",
            "The Fish and Wildlife Service adopted its plan based largely on a study of \u201cinvader removal,\u201d published in 2021, in which researchers set up five pairs of test plots. On one plot, they left barred owls and spotted owls to their own devices. On the other plot, they shot any barred owls that entered.",
            "BQA long-term field experiment showed that where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "The researchers eliminated 2,485 barred owls over several years in the managed plots. Where barred owls and spotted owls were left alone, the population of the threatened species declined around 12 percent each year. Where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "\u201cThe use of long-term field experiments to test the effectiveness of removals in benefitting impacted native species is rare,\u201d said David Wiens, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist and the lead author of the paper. \u201cThis study is the largest field experiment ever conducted on the demographic consequences of invasive competition between predatory birds.\u201d",
            "Steep population declines of northern spotted owls, which live only in old-growth and mature second-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, raised alarms more than 35 years ago. Continued logging of those forests, experts said at the time, would drive the bird to extinction. In June 1990, the bird was listed as a threatened species in the Pacific Northwest and logging in its habitat was restricted.\n",
            "The federal action created a storm of controversy, but it prevented the extinction of the spotted owl. Efforts to prevent the disappearance of the owl, then and now, are not just about protecting a charismatic predator. Spotted owls are an indicator species for the health of the old-growth ecosystem: If a forest has adequate populations of flying squirrels, mice, and salamanders to sustain spotted owls, the forest is likely to be diverse and healthy. Spotted owls only live in mature forests, while barred owls can thrive in both young and old forests and eat a far wider range of prey.",

            "Logging of old growth forest on public lands has, for the most part, halted, and some logged areas are now being restored. But while the logging battles have died down, the new controversy over the proper response to what has been called an invasion of barred owls has heated up as the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s final decision nears.",
            "Biologists believe that the barred owl began moving out of eastern North America and across Canada with the westward movement of European settlers. In a two-part paper, the former FWS biologist Kent Livezey concluded that the lack of trees on the Great Plains created a barrier to owl movement until settlers appeared. They excluded fire from ecosystems, which eventually allowed forests to spread, and they planted trees on farms and in towns, all of which provided an expansion of roosting habitat. Wheat and other grain farms may have increased the numbers of mice and other prey.",
            "Barred owls were first observed in Washington, Oregon, and California in the 1970s, and today there are more than 100,000 of them living in the northern spotted owl\u2019s territory in those states, according to federal biologists.",
            "When barred owls move into spotted owl habitat, the impact is rapid and thorough. The interlopers are larger and more aggressively territorial. They drive spotted owls away from their nests and outcompete the smaller birds for food. At least half the spotted owls in the forests of the West have been lost to barred owls, says the Fish and Wildlife Service, and some places have lost three-quarters of their historic population. When barred owls colonized Redwoods State and National Parks in Northern California, starting in 1987, the spotted owls all but disappeared.",
            "BQBiologists considered capturing and sterilizing barred owls, but they would still return to their territory and displace spotted owls.",
            "The plan to shoot barred owls will protect the northern spotted owl, a subspecies that occurs in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia, which now has fewer than five northern spotted owls, including a lone female.",
            "The number of northern spotted owls in the United States isn\u2019t precisely known: Estimates put the population at just a few thousand. Its continuing decline, however, is steep. In areas where roughly 200 spotted owls lived in the early 2000s, only two or three birds remain, said Robin Bown, a FWS biologist in Oregon. The bird is currently listed as threatened. FWS scientists say it is warranted for listing as endangered, but the agency says such action is precluded because it must focus on higher priority species.\n",
            "The California spotted owl, another subspecies, was last year proposed for listing as endangered in the southern part of its range and threatened in the Sierra Nevada. Barred owls are just beginning their invasion of that bird\u2019s habitat, and the FWS strategy is to dispatch them as soon as they are detected. The Mexican spotted owl is listed as threatened in both the U.S. and Mexico but is not currently threatened by the barred owl.",
            "Though the plan to kill hundreds of thousands of owls is extreme, federal wildlife officials say other options simply aren\u2019t available. Capturing the birds and moving them elsewhere was contemplated. \u201cWe contacted the eastern states where barred owls are native, to see if they wanted barred owls back,\u201d said Bown. \u201cThey said \u2018no.\u2019 Their existing habitat is already full.\u201d Moving them could also spread disease and parasites. They also considered capturing and caging barred owls, but maintaining so many birds would be prohibitively expensive, never mind the fact that there aren\u2019t enough qualified facilities to house barred owls for the rest of their lives.",

            "The federal government has long experience with eliminating wild animals to preserve endangered species. To protect endangered warblers and other songbirds, hundreds of thousands of cowbirds, a nest parasite, have been killed annually. Wildlife managers in Washington and Oregon lethally inject sea lions to protect salmon runs. Feral hogs are routinely slaughtered to protect threatened and endangered species.",
            "The Fish and Wildlife Service plans to work with individual landowners and representatives from tribes and federal and state agencies, training and certifying volunteers to remove the invasive species as humanely as possible. The service emphasizes that there is no public hunting of barred owls permitted.\n",

            "\u201cWe have removed 4,500 barred owls with the same protocol in experimental removals in the last 12 or 15 years without a single non-target injury or death,\u201d said Bown. Shooters will head into the woods at night, with flashlights and megaphones. \u201cWe will project territorial barred-owl sounds,\u201d said Bown, explaining what\u2019s known as a callback survey. \u201cIf barred owls are there, they will respond and usually approach us.\u201d Shooters must be within a hundred feet of their target, she said, and \u201chave a good clean shot.\u201d Carcasses will quickly be buried in the forest.",

            "The barred owl removal plan has drawn criticism as well as reluctant support. Hilary Franz, the Commissioner of Public Lands for Washington State, has concerns about the culling. She posted comments, which she sent to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, about the planned culling on YouTube. \u201cIt raises enormous amounts of questions,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can the Fish and Wildlife Service guarantee that only barred owls will be targeted? How can we prevent the surviving barred owls from simply recolonizing and repopulating the very areas we are trying to preserve? And with so many species now facing extinction, how can we justify spending nearly a billion dollars on one species when our funding and resources are limited?\u201d",

In March, 75 organizations led by Animal Wellness Action president Wayne Pacelle sent a letter to Haaland opposing the shooting of the birds, calling the movement of invasive owls \u201cadaptive range expansion\u201d and an instinctive response to climate change. \u201cWe cannot victimize animals for adapting to human perturbations of the environment, perhaps especially the all-encompassing effects of climate change,\u201d they wrote.",
            "The Center for Biological Diversity, meanwhile, is supportive of the cull. \u201cI hate to see any animal killed, but the spotted owl will certainly go extinct without an effort to reduce invasive barred owl populations,\u201d said Noah Greenwald, the conservation group\u2019s endangered species director. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that in combination with protections for old-growth forests on federal lands, barred owl control will give the spotted owl a real chance at survival.\u201d The American Bird Conservancy also supports the plan, as do some, but not all, Audubon chapters.",
            "Denver Holt, a leading owl researcher who is president of the Owl Research Institute, in Charlo, Montana, questions whether the birds are truly invasive and believes their range expansion across the boreal forest in Canada may be natural. \u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are using the invasive category to kill so many owls. I\u2019d like to see an independent review.\u201d",

The two pilots were not seated front and center; instead, they steered the plane in a capsule attached far out on the right wing. The plane had some other unusual features. On the far-left wing, another slender capsule contained a tank of so-called cryogenic hydrogen, cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius, or minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. A fuel cell inside the plane caused the liquid hydrogen to react with oxygen, producing water and enough electricity to power an electric motor with the propeller attached. The plane flew not with fossil fuel, but with hydrogen.",

His goal is to make so-called \u201cgreen hydrogen,\u201d produced by wind and solar farms, the new standard fuel in aviation. \u201cHydrogen is the most efficient fuel that can be made using renewable energies,\u201d he says.",
            "BQThe aviation industry finds itself in the midst of a struggle over how to clear its reputation as a leading climate polluter. ",

At least two other startup companies, U.S.-based Universal Hydrogen and U.K.-based ZeroAvia, are pursuing this goal, too.

            "Globally, aviation contributes about 2.5 percent to energy-related CO2 emissions, a sizeable share. Contrails and nitrous oxides, byproducts of burning fossil fuels at high altitudes, also contribute to heating Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans, and they could even triple aviation\u2019s climate impact, according to a widely cited 2021 study by Manchester Metropolitan University in the U.K.",

That\u2019s twice as much as in 2022, but still only a miniscule 0.2 percent of the 286 million tons of fossil fuel combusted in planes that year.",
            "Regulators currently allow planes to burn fuel mixtures that contain a maximum of 50 percent SAF, though engineers are retrofitting engines to burn a larger share. Boeing has said that all its new planes will be able to fly with pure SAF by 2030. Deutsche Aircraft, a manufacturer of medium-sized planes, plans to introduce a SAF-only plane, the Dornier 328eco, to the market in 2026 according to Riaan Myburgh, the company\u2019s chief engineer for research and technology. \u201cSAF really is the short-term and even medium-term solution,\u201d he says.",
            "Two problems cast a big shadow: SAF\u2019s availability and its carbon footprint. While most SAFs are currently derived mainly from animal and industrial waste, IATA has called for algae, waste biomass from forestry, agriculture, and municipal waste to be added to the feedstock of refineries as fast as possible. With such a diverse feedstock, however, achieving and proving carbon-neutrality will be difficult. Any kind of biomass feedstock will generate CO2 emissions, for example when energy-intensive fertilizer or diesel tractors and trucks are used in industrial agriculture.",
            "BQBy 2028, says an engineer, the industry must make \u201cits most important decisions on how to become climate neutral.\u201d",
            "That\u2019s also true for so-called \u201celectro-SAF,\u201d which is made by splitting hydrogen from water using renewable energy. This hydrogen is then combined in refineries with carbon from biomass or from industrial exhaust gases to form synthetic kerosene. The process, also called \u201cPower to Liquid,\u201d can only become truly climate-neutral when the necessary carbon is captured directly from the atmosphere using wind or solar power, a technology not yet tested or available at scale.",
            "Against this backdrop, proponents of \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d fuel like H2Fly\u2019s Josef Kallo argue that the best way to move forward is to take carbon out of the equation altogether and simply use pure hydrogen made with renewable electricity as fuel.\n",
            "Bj\u00f6rn Nagel, a 47-year-old aviation engineer and director of the Hamburg-based Institute of System Architectures in Aeronautics, has looked at aviation\u2019s big existential questions from every possible angle in the past years. As head of a team of 60 scientists, he spends his days zipping between virtual reality animations of future planes, experimental robotic assembly lines, rooms crammed with expensive machinery, and meetings with scientists and aircraft manufacturers. His institute is part of the German Aerospace Center, the country\u2019s equivalent of NASA, a research agency with 12,000 employees.",

            "From his research lab on the banks of the Elbe River, Nagel can see the global aircraft production chain in action. Regularly, huge cargo planes appear on the horizon and descend toward a nearby airport, carrying fuselages, wings, and other large plane parts built elsewhere across Europe for his next-door neighbor, Airbus. About half of all the company\u2019s new A320 jets are assembled here.",
            "This proximity increases Nagel\u2019s sense of urgency. \u201cBy 2028,\u201d he says, \u201cthe global aircraft industry must have made its most important decisions on how to become climate neutral.\u201d It takes about seven years to develop a new type of plane, and after becoming operational, these planes will remain in service for 30 to 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a race with time,\u201d he says.",
            "Nagel led one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive studies of aviation\u2019s climate strategies, a project called \u201cEXACT,\u201d in which 165 scientists from 20 institutes compared, among other things, how airports around the world \u2014 Tokyo, Dubai, and Frankfurt among them \u2014 could be supplied with either SAF or hydrogen and how their environmental impacts would differ. They examined how to reduce contrails and nitrous oxide emissions most efficiently, and they came up with futuristic new plane designs, including one with a staggering 10 electric engines and propellers.",
            "BQSustainable fuel might not be available in large enough quantities, and harvesting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems.",
            "The studies underscored the challenges of using hydrogen as aviation fuel. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you can\u2019t just put a hydrogen tank in an airplane and fly off,\u201d Nagel says. New materials are needed to build the planes because tiny hydrogen atoms easily leak and tend to make anything they touch brittle. Nagel acknowledges that deep changes to aircraft architecture are necessary. Computer-simulated hydrogen planes developed in the EXACT study don\u2019t have their fuel tanks spread out in the wings, as current planes do. Instead, they are designed to be nearly spherical, to reduce their surface area and the weight of the insulation needed to keep hydrogen fuel in its cryogenic state. One option under consideration is to place them in the plane\u2019s tail, which would affect the plane\u2019s overall weight balance. ",
            "Fuel cells must also become much lighter and more efficient than they are today. In terms of climate impact, the most important open question is to what extent hydrogen \u2014 which only produces water vapor as an exhaust \u2014 causes contrails. A project is under way in cooperation with Airbus, in which research planes fly behind passenger jets to determine the effects. For SAF, a considerable reduction could be shown compared to fossil jet fuel, since due to their higher chemical purity, SAFs emit much less of the soot that causes contrails.\n",
            "But SAF still has strong downsides. \u201cUsing hydrogen to first synthesize kerosene\u201d \u2014 as in the Power to Liquid process, says Nagel \u2014 \u201cconsumes up to 45 percent more primary energy than using hydrogen directly as a fuel, a huge number.\u201d",

            "fC\nYale Environment 360",
            "Also, the biomass needed for SAF might simply not be available in large enough quantities in the future, and harvesting and collecting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems. In terms of cost, liquid hydrogen fuel will require higher initial investments, Nagel says, but it should come out on par or cheaper than SAFs when their biomass demand, and the high cost of direct air capture of carbon, are figured in. When critics point out that hydrogen requires four times the volume per unit of energy as kerosene, Nagel answers that it weighs three times less. \u201cAccording to our calculations, this largely cancels each other out,\u201d he says.\n",
            "Nagel admits that many challenges remain. \u201cThe devil is in the details\u201d is a phrase he often uses. Overall, he has concluded that hydrogen, if made with electricity from renewable sources, has enough advantages to become the fuel of the future, with SAF and \u201celectro-SAF\u201d filling in for some time to come and for certain demands.",
            "BQAirbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen-powered plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. ",
            "Nagel is convinced that hydrogen\u2019s technological challenges can be resolved. With that goal, his institute is turning a ground-based A320 jet into a \u201cHydrogen Aviation Lab\u201d at Hamburg airport to test components and create a filling station for hydrogen fuel made by the region\u2019s wind farms, in a project run by Lufthansa Technik. The German Aerospace Center is also involved in turning a Dornier 328 into a flying test bed for hydrogen-electric propulsion, and it is testing direct hydrogen combustion engines in Cologne.",
            "But like all big players, the research agency is hedging its bets on aviation\u2019s future. It is also researching Power to Liquid technologies, for which a pilot plant will be built in Eastern Germany. And in the U.S., Boeing is pursuing research on hydrogen propulsion. \u201cWe know it will take an \u2018SAF and\u2019 approach and not an \u2018SAF or\u2019 approach to achieving net-zero by 2050,\u201d Boeing\u2019s Raymond concedes.",
            "Given Boeing\u2019s current massive quality problems with its existing fleet, it is safe to say that hydrogen propulsion will either be developed in Europe, or nowhere. \u201cWe\u2019d like to work with all aircraft manufacturers on hydrogen but it is clear that Boeing has a different focus right now,\u201d Nagel says. In contrast, Airbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. At the Dubai air show last December, Airbus\u2019 chief sustainability officer, Julie Kitcher, radiated optimism when she said that hydrogen propulsion is moving towards \u201ctechnological readiness.\u201d In January, the company opened a brand-new R&D center for hydrogen technologies in Stade, some 40 kilometers north of Hamburg down the Elbe River."

            "There are plenty of ways to remove carbon from the air, each with pros and cons. Planting and protecting forests and other ecosystems \u2014 called nature-based solutions \u2014 is relatively cheap, can be done at large scale, and has a heap of side benefits, including the provision of habitat for endangered species, flood protection, or increased food supplies for humans. The IPCC\u2019s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C calculated that up to 11 billion metric tons of CO2 could be drawn down in this manner per year by 2050, a huge chunk of today\u2019s roughly 35 billion metric tons in emissions. But the amount of carbon stored by nature can be hard to estimate and uncertain: A wildfire can wipe out a forest, for example.\n",
            "According to the IEA, capturing CO2 directly from the flue stacks of power plants and other industrial operations, like concrete plants, which are hard-to-mitigate sectors, should be used to soak up nearly 4 billion metric tons of CO2 a year by 2050. But these methods don\u2019t touch legacy CO2, which is more dilute in the atmosphere. Pulling CO2 straight from the air is expensive, but it can be done nearly anywhere, with easily quantifiable results. The IEA target of roughly 1 billion metric tons by 2050 is a smaller but still substantial slice of the pie.",
            "BQOnce CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it: bury it or use it to make a product.",
            "Today, there are two main strategies for air capture, each of which involves large fans that pull air into a processing area. The first strategy absorbs CO2 onto a solid filter; then a combination of low pressure and moderate temperatures (around 90 degrees C) pulls the concentrated CO2 back out. This process has a relatively high energy requirement, but the biggest plant currently using it \u2014 Climework\u2019s Orca \u2014 makes use of geothermal energy. The capture units \u2014 Orca\u2019s resemble industrial air conditioners the size of a shipping container \u2014 are typically modular, so a capture facility can host just a handful of these units, or many, and be placed basically anywhere there\u2019s ready access to renewable energy.",
            "The second strategy absorbs CO2 into a liquid, transfers the CO2 to limestone pellets, and uses very high temperatures (about 600 degrees C) \u2014 typically supplied by a fossil-fuel-powered furnace \u2014 to remove the CO2 and recover the reagents. The CO2 released from the furnace can be captured too. This system requires a lot of water. But the chemical process is well suited to very large operations. This technique, as developed by the British Columbia-based company Carbon Engineering, is powering Stratos.",
            "Other options are available. The California-based company Heirloom, which opened the first commercial air capture plant in the U.S. last November, with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons a year, uses a variant on the limestone technology. The company simply exposes trays of powdered calcium oxide to air to soak up CO2 and turn it into limestone. Like the other limestone technique, the Heirloom process also releases CO2 from the limestone using high temperatures, but this facility uses renewable energy to do so.",

            "All of this is costly. Businesses can currently buy carbon credits online from Climeworks at the startling price of $1,500 per metric ton. That\u2019s extremely expensive; other voluntary carbon credits \u2014 from schemes that plant trees or make industry more efficient and less polluting, for example \u2014 can be purchased for tens of dollars per metric ton. But these credits are still attractive because they are easily quantifiable, verifiable, and durable over long time periods. Microsoft announced in 2022 that it bought 10,000 metric tons of credits from Climeworks in a 10-year deal, though it did not disclose the price. 1PointFive has deals in place to sell credits to Amazon, Airbus, and other companies once it\u2019s up and running.",
            "Of course, the commercial selling price of carbon credits isn\u2019t the same as the company\u2019s cost of capture. That is surely lower, but numbers are hard to pin down; Climeworks won\u2019t disclose specifics but says $1,000 per metric ton is in the ballpark. The IEA estimates that the operational costs of direct air capture should get to between $230 and $630 per metric ton of CO2 once scaled up, depending in large part on energy costs, says Mathilde Fajardy, an IEA analyst. Others are less optimistic. According to Howard Herzog, of MIT\u2019s Energy Initiative, a reasonable estimate for the cost of direct air capture by 2030 is between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton of CO2. \u201cMost estimates out there are unrealistic,\u201d he says.",
            "BQAbout three-quarters of globally captured C02 is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, which is controversial. ",
            "To tackle both cost and energy use, the DOE\u2019s Carbon Negative Shot program, launched in 2021, ambitiously aims to get the cost of direct air capture below $100 per metric ton by sponsoring technology innovation. That price would make air capture profitable against, for example, a U.S. tax credit that, as of 2022, offers $180 per metric ton for large-scale stored CO2.",
            "Last December, the DOE put up more than $1 million in prize money for promising direct air capture technologies. There are seven semi-finalists. Elysia Labs, in Phoenix, for example, is developing a nanofiber-based sorbent that needs less of a pressure drop and thus requires less energy to pull CO2 from the air. And N\u016bxsen, in New York City, is developing an electrochemical cell that it says can capture and release CO2 without energy-intensive heat or pressure changes; the company plans to use small modular nuclear reactors to power its system.",
            "Meanwhile, some researchers are using artificial intelligence to accelerate innovation. Meta \u2014 the company behind Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is working with Georgia Tech on the OpenDAC project to help find better porous polymers to efficiently soak up and release CO2. Whether any of this proves useful at an industrial scale remains to be seen.",

            "Yet once CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it. The most carbon-negative option is to bury it deep underground. This is what Climeworks does in Iceland, for example, and plans to do with its upgraded facility, called Mammoth, due to launch this year. There are plenty of suitable geological repositories for buried CO2. But for now, this strategy is in the minority: the IEA reports that as of 2022, out of 18 plants operating globally, only two \u2014 both run by Climeworks in Iceland \u2014 bury their CO2.",
            "The other option is to use captured CO2 to make a product \u2014 like fertilizer, for example \u2014 or use it to carbonize beverages or as an ingredient in other industrial chemicals. This is what the majority of direct air capture plants do today. Heirloom, for example, works with a partner company to use its captured CO2 in making concrete. The biggest potential future market could be synthetic fuels for airplanes, wherein captured CO2 is combined with green hydrogen (made by splitting water with renewable electricity) to make synthetic hydrocarbons. The Norsk e-fuel project in Norway, the Haru Oni efuels plant in Chile, the AtmosFUEL project in the U.K., and Carbon Engineering, in Canada, are among companies pursuing this end use. In the IEA\u2019s pathway to net zero, about 35 percent of air-captured CO2 gets used for synthetic fuels by 2050, while the rest is buried.",
            "BQThe energy it takes to power capture, says one critic, would be better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity.",
            "For now, though, about three-quarters of all globally captured CO2 (which comes mainly from industrial flue stacks) is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, says Fajardy. The CO2 gets injected into oil wells to both bury it and to help push out more oil. This is controversial, as many note that it doesn\u2019t disincentivize fossil fuels. \u201cEnhanced oil recovery has been a stepping stone for early carbon capture and storage projects to help with the economics,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cIf your primary goal is negative emissions, it is not a good fit.\u201d But supporters point out that it\u2019s still burying CO2: If done carefully, they claim, then even after burning the recovered oil the process can come out as a net zero or even a net negative equation for carbon, though that\u2019s hard to quantify.",
            "What will happen to Stratos\u2019 CO2 hasn\u2019t yet been decided. The plant\u2019s location in Texas, and the fact that the companies building it, 1PointFive and Carbon Engineering, are both owned by Occidental Petroleum, has led some to speculate that this project will be used for enhanced oil recovery. Kel Coulson, Carbon Engineering\u2019s director of policy, says Stratos has several options for its CO2, including burying it in saline reservoirs or producing low-carbon products, which they call \u201cnet-zero oil.\u201d \u201cThe ultimate use of captured CO2 from Stratos will be driven by customer preference,\u201d Coulson says.",

            "The economic and environmental hurdles leave some concluding that air capture is not a good idea at all. Mark Jacobson, director of the Atmosphere/Energy program at Stanford University, has long been a detractor: The energy it takes to power capture, he says, would be far better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity for decades to come. \u201cThere is never a case where direct air capture or carbon capture is useful,\u201d Jacobson says.",
            "Despite such criticism, the industry is moving forward. Last August, the DOE selected two megaton-scale projects for funding: another 1PointFive venture in Kleberg County, Texas, and an effort in Louisiana called Project Cypress, which has announced it will not participate in enhanced oil recovery. Two more hubs will follow from the DOE. And a handful of other megaton-scale efforts are planned elsewhere, including a Carbon Engineering effort in the United Arab Emirates and Project Bison in Wyoming, which is aiming to capture an ambitious 5 megatons a year by 2030.",
            "If all 100-plus projects on the drawing board go ahead as planned, they\u2019ll capture around 70 metric megatons of CO2 by 2030, says the IEA. That\u2019s very close to their 80 metric megaton target. But it\u2019s also a very big if."

By September, almost 20,000 tons \u2014 about 1,400 dump trucks\u2019 worth \u2014 of \u201cwood waste\u201d had been pushed overboard. This was no attempt to clandestinely offload trash into the sea. Instead, it was one of the latest efforts in the race to rid the atmosphere of excess carbon dioxide.",
            "Most people have heard of land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) schemes, most notably \u201cdirect air capture.\u201d Iceland is a pioneer in this realm \u2014 the Climeworks Orca plant, located not far from the country\u2019s capital, Reykjavik, is vacuuming 4,000 metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere and injecting it deep into the earth each year. But that is far from the amount experts say is necessary. In its most recent assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted that carbon dioxide removal \u201cis required to achieve global and national targets\u201d of limiting warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees C to avoid \u201cmajor, irreversible ecological and social impacts.\u201d\n",
            "To be exact, the IPCC said that removing as much as 15 gigatons of carbon per year may be necessary to stay below the 1.5-degree threshold. That means capturing the equivalent of the annual exhaust of 3.3 billion gasoline-powered cars for 80 years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a one solution problem,\u201d says Nicholas Ward, an earth scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need that 15-gigaton solution that\u2019s going to solve all of our emissions problems \u2014 we need a tool bag of a bunch of five-percent solutions.\u201d",

For billions of years, the ocean has been absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing it to different forms of carbon that circulate via currents or settle to the seafloor. Today, the ocean soaks up 30 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, a capacity that is 42 times greater than the atmosphere\u2019s. Running Tide wants to take advantage of this system by \u201cdeploying\u201d timber industry \u201cwood waste,\u201d which is often sold as feedstock to be burned for bioenergy or simply left to rot \u2014 processes that release the wood\u2019s stored carbon back into the air.",

            "Other mCDR companies are experimenting with growing CO2-consuming aquatic plants, like kelp and algae, then sinking them into the deep ocean or burying them in the earth, much like Iceland\u2019s Climeworks Orca facility buries the carbon it captures from the air. Still others are pumping seawater through electrodialysis filtering systems that both increase the water\u2019s ability to sequester carbon and remove excess acid, a byproduct of CO2 that can devastate marine species.\n",

            "Marine carbon dioxide removal is a form of geoengineering, perhaps the most polarizing word in climate science today. Although scientists and governments seem more alarmed by atmospheric geoengineering efforts, like altering the reflective capacity of the sky with injections of sulfur dioxide, they have also expressed concerns about mCDR, if only because it is so little understood. Iceland\u2019s small size, and its acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, have made it an ideal incubator for mCDR science. But the IPCC\u2019s and other groups\u2019 increasingly dire warnings about the need to act now, and to act in a multitude of ways that include mCDR, has been loud enough to get the attention of much larger governments, including the Biden administration.",

            "Last year, the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) created a program specifically aimed at supporting the development of technology to improve scientists\u2019 ability to measure and monitor carbon in the ocean. In October, the program \u2014 called Sensing Exports of Anthropogenic Carbon Through Ocean Observation (SEA-CO2) \u2014 announced its first tranche of funding: $36 million to be distributed among 11 labs, academic institutions, and private companies in nine states.",
            "Ward and his colleagues at PNNL\u2019s Sequim, Washington, campus have been awarded just over $2 million to develop models and lab experiments to better understand the effectiveness and impact of one of the better-understood mCDR techniques \u2014 ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE). Reducing the acidity of seawater increases its alkalinity; the higher its alkalinity, the more atmospheric CO2 it can absorb and transform into stabler, inorganic carbon, which is less likely to seep back into the air. Since last year, the company Ebb Carbon has been operating its OAE system at the Sequin campus, filtering seawater through a series of membranes that, when pulsed with electricity, extract its acid. With its federal grant, Ward says, the lab will be testing OAE methods from a handful of other companies.\n",

Such facilities, according to Eisaman, yield around 40 billion gallons of brine a day, globally, most of which is discharged into the sea. \u201cIf you convert all that salt to alkalinity with the process we\u2019re pursuing,\u201d he says, more than 1 billion tons of CO2 are pulled from the air and stored in the ocean per year. To reduce acidification at oceanic scales would be impossible, but Eisaman says that isn\u2019t Ebb Carbon\u2019s goal. He pointed to the oyster farms in the bays and estuaries around Sequin that have been suffering from acidification, which thins the shells of bivalves. \u201cYou could use this to kind of keep that relatively small local body of water similar to a preindustrial equilibrium that is ideal for shellfish.\u201d ",
            "Instead of using electricity to shock the acid from seawater, other companies are experimenting with alkaline rocks, like basalt or olivine, which over thousands of years break down and make their way into the oceans. To speed up that natural process, often called \u201cenhanced rock weathering,\u201d the material can be mined, pulverized, and mixed into the ocean. Eisaman argues that \u201copen systems\u201d like this, which use the Earth\u2019s own carbon cycle instead of \u201cclosed systems\u201d like direct air capture, are \u201capproaches that will have the potential to scale gigatons and at low cost.\u201d (Running Tide also coats its wood chips with an alkaline material, with the goal of simultaneously transferring CO2 to the ocean and combating acidification.)",

Such sensors would benefit companies that aim to grow macroalgae \u2014 seaweed and kelp \u2014 that draw large amounts of CO2 from the air, then sink them into the deep ocean. But some scientists say such efforts are risky. As it breaks down in the water column, this biomass produces organic carbon that \u201ccan be eaten by bacteria, which causes all sorts of transformations in the environment,\u201d says Ward. \u201cFor example, on the seafloor, you have organic carbon that can transform into different greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide and methane, depending on the conditions. If we\u2019re not monitoring for production of these other greenhouse gases, we can\u2019t tell you exactly how much carbon was truly sequestered.\u201d \n",

In 2021, the company filed a patent for a floating apparatus seeded with kelp and \u201cenhanced with a nutrient payload\u201d of iron oxide to spur the growth of phytoplankton blooms, which can consume large amounts of atmospheric CO2. The plan raised enough concerns about unintended consequences that some of the company\u2019s scientists reportedly quit. In a 2022 article published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the University of Tasmania marine biochemist Phillip Boyd and coauthors modeled the potential impacts of apparatuses like that proposed by Running Tide, concluding that they would likely present a \u201crange of biological threats\u201d for offshore ecosystems, from altered water chemistry to the introduction of invasive microorganisms. Asked to respond to that criticism, Running Tide\u2019s Hr\u00f3bjartsson said in an email, \u201cWe would never, and never have, deployed anything into the ocean that isn\u2019t deemed at most a minor or transitory impact on the ocean environment by best available science.\u201d",

            "Ultimately, Boyd and his coauthors concluded that there was a great need for just the kind of research that the SEA-CO2 program will produce. \u201cMarine carbon removal is a very challenging field, because it\u2019s not just about the science,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cThere\u2019s the technology aspect, the economics, the communicating to the public, the regulatory frameworks, and then there\u2019s the markets. And, as far as I can see, none of those are really fit for purpose at the moment.\u201d",
            "BQSome scientists say CO2 removal is simply a distraction from the urgency of the climate crisis and an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels.",
            "Despite the fact that scientists are only just beginning to look into the effectiveness of mCDR, private carbon markets are flourishing, and private investors have been betting big on its success.

            "Of course, recent years have shown the grave danger of Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite mantra, \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d When it comes to the environment, moving fast may be critical, but breaking things can be catastrophic. Some scientists have made the point that carbon dioxide removal \u2014 and the sale of those carbon credits \u2014 is simply a distraction from the urgency of the climate crisis and an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels. Friederike Otto, a lead author of the latest IPCC report, recently told The Guardian that the tools to keep warming to 1.5 degrees are already available and completely understood: stop extracting fossil fuels, scale back industrial farming and deforestation, the list goes on. \u201cWe should act as if CDR will never be achievable,\u201d Otto said. \u201cWe do not have a technology at the moment that works at scale\u2026 so we should make our policies as if CDR is not an option.\u201d",

If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

            "The geothermal industry would appear to offer a relatively seamless shift for many oilfield workers. Often, contractors can simply apply their skills to hot water instead of oil. As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

            "*The_Pinyon_Plain_uranium_mine,_which_recently_opened_in_Arizona",
            "After sitting dormant since the 1980s, the Pinyon Plain uranium mine began operating in January on the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona, about seven miles south of the Grand Canyon. Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L. Wald, an energy analyst for the American Nuclear Society, a nonprofit organization that promotes nuclear power, and the Breakthrough Institute. \u201cThe domestic uranium mining industry is being brought back to life.\u201d",

Solar and wind will provide some of the needed power, but as the need for electricity soars, especially to charge electric vehicles, he said, \u201cthey are looking extremely eagerly at advanced reactors.\u201d",
            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",
            "BQSupporters of uranium mining say new methods are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past.",
            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",
            "What will this new era of uranium mining mean for the environment? Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage. In some places, damage has been remediated by industry and government. But in many cases, due to cost or the difficulty of remediation, the pollution still contaminates the environment.",
            "But supporters of uranium mining say that new methods and technologies are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past and have far smaller footprints. That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach. The \u201cpregnant\u201d solution is then pumped to the surface, where uranium is extracted in a recovery plant.",

            "In-situ mining \u2014 which requires a series of wells but no open pit \u2014 causes far less surface disturbance than open-pit mining, uses less water, and leaves behind no contaminated tailings or waste rock. Fifty-seven percent of the world\u2019s total uranium was produced using in-situ leaching in 2019, up from 16 percent in 2000, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group.",
            "\u201cWhen [the U.S.] led the world in production in 1980, much of our production was conventional open pit and underground,\u201d said Scott Melbye, president of Uranium Producers of America and CEO of Uranium Royalty, which provides capital for mines. \u201cEighty to 90 percent of production going forward [will be] coming from in-situ recovery.\u201d",
            "Mines in the U.S., he said, are held to extremely high standards compared with mines in some other countries, and nuclear energy is going to play a much larger role in the future of energy. \u201cIf we cross our arms and say we don\u2019t want any mining in the United States, that just means you are willing to take stuff from Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan, and the Congo, where there is child labor and no attention paid to air quality or water quality or all those things.\u201d",

            "In-situ mining, however, is not without risks, which include the contamination of groundwater with radon, heavy metals, and leaching fluids. The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this. It sounds straightforward, and it is.\u201d ",
            "Those most skeptical of the new era of uranium mining are people who live near old mining sites across the American West, where the scramble to find uranium to build the first atomic bombs during the Cold War left open pits and radioactive waste piles and dust scattered across the landscape.

The company pumped this excess water into an open-air holding pond. But the pond wasn\u2019t big enough, so the company used water cannons to spray the overflow, which was tainted with arsenic and uranium at levels well above federal standards, into the sky to enhance the evaporation rate.\n",

In a world in which national climate targets are being missed, the speed and scale of expansion in China\u2019s installed renewable capacity is unmatched. ",
            "In 2020, for example, China pledged to reach 1,200 gigawatts of renewables capacity by 2030, more than double its capacity at that time. At its present pace, it will meet that target by 2025, and could boast as much as 1,000 gigawatts of solar power alone by the end of 2026, an achievement that would make a substantial contribution to the 11,000 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity that the world needs to meet the 2030 targets of the Paris Agreement. Fossil fuels now make up less than half of China\u2019s total installed generation capacity, a dramatic reduction from a decade ago when fossil fuels accounted for two-thirds of its power capacity. \n",
            "BQIn 2022, China installed roughly as much solar capacity as the rest of the world combined, then doubled additional solar in 2023.",
            "When the International Energy Authority issued its assessment of the pledge to triple renewables globally by 2030, it pointed out that the 50 percent increase in global renewable installations in 2023 was largely driven by China. In 2022, China installed roughly as much solar photovoltaic capacity as the rest of the world combined, then went on in 2023 to double new solar installations, increase new wind capacity by 66 percent, and almost quadruple additions of energy storage.",
            "For the past two decades, China has been notorious as the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, a country that also uses as much heavily polluting coal as the rest of the world combined. How did it also become the world\u2019s renewable powerhouse? ",
            "Part of the answer goes back to investment decisions made in the mid-2000s when China\u2019s decades-long phase of rapid GDP growth was coming to an end. Labor costs were rising, and China\u2019s development model, with its overwhelming dependence on coal, had plunged China into multiple crises of air, soil, and water pollution. In the first decade of this century, China\u2019s emissions more than doubled, and by 2006 it had overtaken the U.S. to earn the unwelcome title of the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by volume.\n",

            "China\u2019s leadership was alert to the negative diplomatic impacts of being the world\u2019s worst polluter, especially in those countries most vulnerable to climate impacts. At the same time, China\u2019s own exposure to climate change effects, on top of its escalating pollution crisis and the public unrest it was generating, was becoming a significant topic in Beijing\u2019s top-level policy discussions. China\u2019s planners were looking for investments that would create an opportunity for a more advanced technological future, and this coincided with the need to clean up China\u2019s environment and the global effort to cut emissions. All this pointed to supporting the development of the renewable technologies the world would need if it was to avoid climate catastrophe. ",
            "In the next and every subsequent five-year plan, China made strategic investments in all aspects of renewable technologies, from solar and wind capacity, green hydrogen, and geothermal projects to research and investment in battery storage and its supply chains. In the first phase of its rapid industrial development starting in the 1990s, China had been obliged to license technologies owned by others. Now the strategic ambition was to dominate the field, positioning China as the global supplier of goods to an increasingly carbon-constrained world. \n",
            "BQIf China has been clear about the opportunity side of climate change, it has been less enthusiastic about cutting its own emissions.",
            "Within a decade, China had largely achieved its goal of dominating not only the production of solar and wind technologies, but it had developed a near monopoly on every aspect of the supply chains, including the mining and processing of the rare-earths and strategic minerals essential for the clean energy revolution. Today, China has more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s solar manufacturing capacity. The extraordinary scale of China\u2019s renewables sector output has driven down prices worldwide, and this is a key factor in reducing the cost barrier to renewable systems for poorer countries. Today China not only holds important positions in wind and battery technologies, but a Chinese company, BYD, has become the world\u2019s biggest EV manufacturer, and China is poised to pose a formidable global challenge in all aspects of electric transportation to established vehicle brands.",
            "But if China has been clear about the opportunity side of climate change, it has been less enthusiastic about cutting its own emissions: In the first two decades of the century, the economy remained overwhelmingly dependent on coal, and China argued that committing to major cuts in emissions would be an unfair constraint on its right to develop. That began to change with President Xi Jinping\u2019s surprise announcement at the 2020 U.N. General Assembly that China would peak its emissions \u201cwell before\u201d 2030, as it had promised in Paris in 2015, and in an important new offer, that it would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060. A radical renewables program would be essential to meeting those goals.\n",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17082093/embed",
            "Xi Jinping\u2019s announcement attracted global attention, but its most galvanizing effect was at home. It sent a powerful political signal in favor of renewable investments across China, and the nation\u2019s giant state-owned enterprises, including its traditional energy companies, were compelled to take notice, both of Xi\u2019s unequivocal message and the policy initiatives it triggered. The National Energy Administration (NEA), the body that regulates China\u2019s energy sector, also recognized that new policies and mechanisms would be needed if China was to implement Xi\u2019s targets. ",
            "Massive wind farms were already operating in northern China, and now a series of utility-scale clean energy bases involving many of China\u2019s massive state-owned utility companies were planned for the relatively empty western desert regions. These bases, a combination of vast solar arrays and wind farms, are to be connected to markets in eastern China through high-speed transmission lines. The projects take advantage both of high solar radiation in the desert and large amounts of cheap, available land. China aims to build more than 200 such bases to help to raise its renewables capacity to about 3.9 terawatts by 2030, more than three times its 2022 total.",
            "BQChina still generates about 70 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels, as renewable energy use lags behind installed capacity.",
            "In addition to these desert projects, the NEA promised in 2021 to improve rural grid transmission and allow village collectives to invest in distributed renewable power and share the benefits. To promote the adoption of distributed rooftop solar, the NEA launched the Whole County PV program, a national pilot scheme that aimed to install photovoltaics in roughly half of China\u2019s county-level rural administrations, comprising about a quarter of China\u2019s population. The program set targets of providing solar to 20 percent of residential properties, with separate targets for commercial buildings.",
            "The utility-scale developments had left out China\u2019s more scattered rural populations, so showing interest in a rural model in which customers both draw energy down and sell energy back to the grid was a radical departure for China\u2019s traditional central planners and grid operators. The NEA now aimed to include China\u2019s neglected rural population in the renewable revolution. By the end of 2022, 676 counties had signed up for the scheme, and more than 51 gigawatts of new distributed solar photovoltaic was installed, nearly half of it on from rural rooftops. In total, by the end of 2022, China had built roughly 157 gigawatts of distributed photovoltaic capacity, more than double that of the U.S.",

            "fCWorkers inspect a rooftop solar array in Fuzhou, China.\nCostfoto / NurPhoto via AP",
            "The NEA also announced plans to expand the financing channels for renewables and improve incentives and market mechanisms, aiming to shift the state-owned banks from favoring state-owned enterprises and from undervaluing both the private sector and new policy initiatives.",
            "Today the renewables sector is one of the relatively few bright spots in the Chinese economy, having benefited from a surge in government stimulus as Beijing tried to restore growth hit hard by Covid-19. The massive real estate market, which boosted China\u2019s GDP figures for more than three decades, is teetering on the edge of collapse. The pandemic and the downturn in global economies that followed has hit China\u2019s exports, and nervous Chinese consumers are sitting on their wallets in case things get worse. Renewable energy, however, seems to have a bright future, but fully realizing that potential will demand further radical reforms.",
            "Renewables now account for half of China\u2019s installed capacity, but there has also been a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants, and China still generates about 70 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels. This means actual renewable energy use is lagging behind installed capacity.",
            "BQThe government has announced plans to create a unified electricity system, merging regional grids into one national market.",
            "This is largely due to problems with China\u2019s giant grid, which prefers high-speed transmission from reliable sources to the challenge of integrating variable renewable power and the associated challenge of matching intermittent supply to demand. For the grid companies, China\u2019s coal-fired power plants are steady and predictable, and they are allowed many more hours of grid access than renewables. In addition, anxieties about energy security are now high on the policy agenda, reinforced by geopolitical tensions and recent droughts that affected hydropower output and resulted in power cuts. In China, energy security still means coal.",
            "China\u2019s current climate and energy ambitions are embedded in a series of policy statements, including its current five-year plan. Although China\u2019s political culture places a heavy premium on meeting its declared goals, a number of energy and climate commitments are currently off target, largely because of the energy sector\u2019s continuing dependence on coal.\n",
            "In 2021, in the Paris Agreement commitments that China submitted to the U.N., Beijing pledged to \u201cstrictly limit\u201d coal growth, strictly control new coal power, reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025, increase the share of non-fossil energy sources to 20 percent by 2025 and to 25 percent by 2030, and to generate 50 percent of the increase in energy use from 2020 to 2025 from renewable sources. Far from limiting coal growth, however, according to analysis by Carbon Brief, a new coal rush is underway as operators seize what they see as possibly the last opportunity for new plants.",
            "*An_EV_battery_factory_in_Nanjing",
            "fCAn EV battery factory in Nanjing.\nFeature China / Future Publishing via Getty Images",
            "The figures confirm the trend: The average growth rate of coal consumption increased eightfold in the last two years, from 0.5 percent per year between 2016 and 2020 to 3.8 percent per year between 2021 and 2023, and new coal power approvals quadrupled between 2022 and 2023 as compared with the five years before the government pledged its strict controls.",
            "This has contributed to a 12 percent rise in emissions in the energy sector between 2020 and 2023. To meet the government\u2019s 2025 carbon intensity targets, emissions would have to peak this year and decline by 4 to 6 percent by 2025. Some analysts consider these targets already out of reach, but if China is to stay on track with its long- and short-term goals, the government must honor its pledge to control new coal capacity and continue its rapid buildup of renewables.",
            "To use its renewables capacity efficiently however, China has recognized that power system reforms are long overdue. The National Development and Reform Commission recently announced plans to create a unified national power market by 2030, merging its six regional grids into one nationwide electricity market to better manage fluctuations in supply and demand. If that can be achieved, China could not only enhance its position as the global leader in installed capacity for renewable but might also make better use of the clean energy it produces."

Undeterred, Stefan Zaenker, leading a group of four volunteers, runs through his checklist alongside a forest road. Are rubber boots disinfected to prevent introducing potentially harmful microorganisms into the wetland? Are the team app and GPS functioning correctly? Have enough flags been packed?",
            "When all is in order, Zaenker, 56, leads the group into a soggy alder forest. Its mission for the day: to locate and map as-yet-undiscovered springs and document any species inhabiting them.\n",
            "A senior conservation official for the state of Hesse, Zaenker considers springs so important for human life and biodiversity that he \u2014 along with volunteers from the Hesse Association for Cave and Karst Research \u2014 spends much of his spare time conducting large-scale searches for them in the Rh\u00f6n, which includes the German states of Bavaria, Thuringia, and Hesse, and in a nearby national park.\n",
            "Conservation strategies around the globe focus on rivers, bogs, forests, reefs, and many other habitat types. Springs rarely get any special attention. In the United States, for example, springs do \u201cnot appear to be a prominent feature on the conservation radar,\u201d says Kirsten Work, a zoologist from Stetson University in DeLand, Florida.\n",
            "BQSprings are home to highly specialized species, some of which live outside by night and in the darkness of groundwater by day.",
            "But for the biosphere, these tiny spots dotted across Earth\u2019s land surface play a powerful role: They connect reservoirs of groundwater to the outside, sunlit world. Only so-called \u201cfossil\u201d aquifers \u2014 ancient bodies of groundwater that do not recharge \u2014 lack a link with the surface. Without a continual connection to groundwater, which also feeds rivers, many landscapes would quickly dry up and become hotter. In addition, springs are home to a wide range of highly specialized species, some of which live outside by night and in the darkness of groundwater by day.",
            "Far too little is known about where springs occur and what species they harbor, Zaenker says. In a country like Germany, which has no wilderness but a very efficient bureaucracy, most people assume that everything in nature has already been discovered and mapped. This is not true, he claims: \u201cI can stand right next to an impressive spring with water flowing out, but the official topographical map shows nothing.\u201d Official maps denote springs with a blue dot, indicating they are habitats protected by law. Yet many \u2014 if not most \u2014 springs remained undocumented. \u201cHow are we going to effectively protect these important habitats or know if they dry up,\u201d asks Zaenker, \u201cif we don\u2019t even know they exist?\u201d",

To the average person, they can look like puddles. But Zaenker recognizes much more in them. \u201cSee the bright green plant?\u201d he points out. \u201cThat\u2019s the alternate-leaved golden saxifrage, a species typical for springs.\u201d The team logs the flags\u2019 positions in a database, then measures pH levels and electrical conductivity to assess the water\u2019s acidity and dissolved particle content. They collect water samples, identify more plants, and sift through leaves to find insects, mollusks, and crustaceans unique to these habitats.",
            "Halfway around the globe, ecologist Larry Stevens is on a similar mission and is equally worried about the future of springs. In 2013, Stevens cofounded the Springs Stewardship Institute, a nonprofit science initiative linked with the Museum of Northern Arizona, and in 2023 he published Springs of the World: Distribution, Ecology, and Conservation. Stevens considers springs prime examples of \u201ccanaries in coal mines\u201d because they act as early warning systems of water table decline and biodiversity loss.",
            "BQ Some experts use springs as sentinels for aquifer health, observing whether their temperatures increase or their discharges fall.",
            "Stevens is particularly fascinated by the large number of highly specialized and endemic species found in and around springs. He points out that with constant temperatures and high purity, spring water offers unique living conditions. Springs are often isolated from one another geographically and many have been in place for millennia, characteristics that make them hotspots for new species to arise and refuges for species that have lost their habitats elsewhere. \u201cAlthough miniscule in habitat area compared to rivers, lakes, and oceans, springs support more than 10 percent of U.S. endangered species, as well as thousands of other rare and endemic biota,\u201d he notes. For example, the so-called Comal Springs riffle beetle is limited to a few springs in Texas, while the endangered White River springfish lives only in isolated warm springs in eastern Nevada.\n",
            "While there are many spectacular springs \u2014 like the white Pamukkale terraces of Turkey, Blue Spring in New Zealand, or the hot springs in Yellowstone National Park \u2014 most are rather inconspicuous. That doesn\u2019t diminish their importance, though. Every creek, river, pond, and lake starts with at least one, and often many, springs.",
            "But public recognition of springs\u2019 importance has diminished. Most people no longer retrieve water from springs but get it through municipal supplies. \u201cSprings have been systematically piped, tapped, built over, and even today they are run over by forest trucks and polluted by excrements from cattle, fertilizers, and pesticides,\u201d Zaenker says.",

            "When the Swiss canton of Jura mapped a total of 1,750 known springs, half showed severe damage from piping or pollution or had been outright destroyed by development. In addition, groundwater levels in many regions around the globe are rapidly dropping due to over-pumping and diminished rainfall. Some scientists and conservation bodies have started to use springs as sentinels for aquifer health, observing whether their temperatures increase or their discharges fall.\n",
            "Drawing on more than 40 years of data from 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems across the globe, scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and other institutions determined in January 2024 that \u201cwidespread, rapid, and accelerating groundwater-level declines\u201d are underway in many regions of world, in some cases by up to 50 centimeters per year. Sustained rain can help replenish aquifers, but this is not a given as the climate continues to change. In Germany, many months with intensive rainfall still haven\u2019t balanced out a water deficit from six years of drought, satellite measurements show. In the Swiss survey, almost one in five springs had dried up or could no longer be located.",
            "In 2023, Work, of Stetson University, warned that half of 126 springs in the U.S. for which long-term records exist exhibited declines in discharge. After assessing data on 10,000 springs in the U.S., Work now calls for a concerted effort to study springs and their ecosystems more intensively, as they are \u201clikely to become even more important in the future as climate changes and their roles as freshwater refuges, temperature buffers, and bellwethers become even more important.\u201d",
            "BQOne conservation official estimates that there could be as many as 5,000 species living at springs throughout Germany.",
            "There is still a great deal that\u2019s unknown about springs, Work says: \u201cWhere they all are, how exactly they connect with below ground, what biodiversity they support.\u201d She notes that in Florida, springs provide a warm water refuge to manatees in winter and a cool water refuge for fish and other species in summer. According to a 2019 Florida Springs Institute assessment of 32 so-called \u201csentinel\u201d springs in the Florida Springs Region, all were \u201cslightly to greatly impaired, many are endangered or more seriously impaired, and some have collapsed.\u201d\n",

            "The 15 volunteers supporting the mapping project have already found around 2,700 animal species at springs in the Rh\u00f6n. Zaenker estimates that there could be as many as 5,000 species living at springs throughout Germany. Many specimens are hard to identify. Over the years, Zaenker has built up a network of 90 experts at natural history museums throughout Europe, to whom he sends samples and consults with. \u201cSome species can only be distinguished based on genitalia or other details,\u201d he says, \u201cand some turn out to be new to science.\u201d",
            "The most cherished species in the Rh\u00f6n \u2014 often featured on educational placards \u2014 is an endemic only two millimeters in size: the Rh\u00f6n spring snail. According to Hans Boeters, a leading expert on spring snail taxonomy, Bythinella compressa has occupied larger territories in the past 2.6 million years. But as waters became more polluted and lower-elevation regions warmed, the snail was limited to the clean and consistently cold springs high in the Rh\u00f6n\u2019s rolling hills.",
            "BQ\u201cWith healthy springs,\u201d says a conservationist, \u201cyoung trees will have a better chance of surviving the next heat wave.\u201d",
            "Boeters is concerned about the species\u2019 prospects of survival. \u201cSpring snails are site-loyal,\u201d he says, \u201cand if a population is destroyed, there will be no recolonization.\u201d",
            "Managers of the Rh\u00f6n biosphere reserve have started fencing off springs that still host the rare snail to exclude cattle. And pipes and concrete blocks are being removed so spring creatures can move freely between surface and groundwater. Eva Schubert, a conservation manager with Landesbund f\u00fcr Vogel- und Naturschutz (LBV), a conservation organization associated with BirdLife International, emphasizes the importance of springs for forest survival in a warming world. \u201cWith healthy springs,\u201d she says, \u201cthe forest floor will be moister, and young trees will have a better chance of surviving the next heat wave.\u201d",
            "Over two days of reconnaissance work, Zaenker\u2019s team found 50 springs that don\u2019t yet appear on official maps. After returning home, Zaenker realized that over 20 years he has documented exactly 8,000 springs. \u201cThat\u2019s about 10 times as many springs as are officially listed on the maps for this region,\u201d he says. After each outing, he feeds his data into the official geographical information system of the forest authorities so they can avoid those springs during logging operations. Initially, his concerns fell on deaf ears there, he recalls. \u201cNow, I regularly get invited to training courses to make forestry workers aware of springs and why they need protection.\u201d",
            "So far, Zaenker\u2019s project has not changed the attitudes and awareness of official mapmakers. But when they are ready to represent all springs as protected habitats with blue dots, his vast database will be available for their use."

In its annual report for 2024, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) \u2014 the regional fishery advisory body whose findings provided the basis for the EU\u2019s Eel Regulation \u2014 is now urging that \u201cthere should be zero catches in all habitats.\u201d For many biologists, closing down the eel fishery, at least temporarily, seems like the last option left after many years of neglect. \u201cIt\u2019s been a century of \u2018we knew the problem and we didn\u2019t face it,\u2019\u201d Willem Dekker, a Dutch biologist known as the architect of the EU Eel Regulation, told me.",
            "Eels are at once a familiar component of European culture and a mystery to everyone who has ever studied them. Aristotle tried to crack the question of eel reproduction as early as the 300s B.C., eventually concluding that the fish must miraculously generate out of muddy riverbeds. At the time, no one had found the eels\u2019 sex organs. Nor had they witnessed eels reproducing in the wild, a page in the scientific record that remains blank to this day: no pair of European eels has ever been caught in the act.",

            "fCEel fishers in Comacchio, Italy.\nAndrea Izzotti / Vecteezy",
            "European eels are born in the Sargasso Sea, an amorphous body of water in the Western Atlantic bordered not by land but by shifting ocean currents. The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs. (Freud spent the spring of 1876 in Trieste, about a hundred miles northeast of Comacchio, fruitlessly picking apart healthy eels from the Adriatic for his advisor in Vienna.)\n",
            "BQThe market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels.",
            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

            "Since management authorities cannot rely on aquaculture to meet market demand and relieve pressure on wild eel stocks, they have had to focus on more direct conservation strategies. But they are struggling to come up with solutions, since the reasons for the European eel\u2019s collapse are not straightforward. Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980. There are clearly a number of factors at play in this long decline, but the extent of each is uncertain.",
            "Overfishing, it seems, is only one piece of the puzzle, as shown by the failure of the EU\u2019s fishing regulations to produce a recovery. Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle. The recent surge of illegal trafficking of juveniles to Asia has surely put another dent in the population.",
            "\u201cPeople want to have a clear answer, but we\u2019re not able to provide it,\u201d admitted Caroline Durif, one of the current chairs of the ICES Working Group on Eels. When asked the reason for the eels\u2019 sharp decline, Willem Dekker said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Full stop. Fishing, habitat loss, pollution, all those things, nobody knows.\u201d\n",
            "BQThe mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. ",
            "In order to ban the capture of European eels, as proposed by ICES, the European Parliament would need to repeal and amend the current EU directive requiring countries to adopt measures to support the stock\u2019s recovery. This seems unlikely given that a 2023 committee vote on a resolution calling for renewed commitment to the regulation won the support of 80 percent of delegates present. \u201cThere\u2019s no will to do a ban, and also it wouldn\u2019t help,\u201d Andrew Kerr, the chair of a nonprofit coalition of conservationists, scientists, and commercial fishermen called the Sustainable Eel Group (SEG), told me over video call from his home in England. \u201cThe eel is much more complex than that, and if you stop fishing, you\u2019re not going to save the eel. What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",
            "Durif acknowledges that the EU still needs some convincing from the scientific community before it will accept a zero-catch limit. \u201cThe EU is working on making a special request to ICES to see if we can measure the efficiency of the regulation, which we keep on saying we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",
            "Kerr has been writing to the EU for over a decade and has spoken to gathered authorities at the Hague on the problem of illegal glass eel shipments. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to make eel become an EU priority in countertrafficking,\u201d he said. In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

All seven sea turtle species are currently endangered or threatened, notes Christine Figgener, a German-born conservation biologist who has been working in Costa Rica for the past 16 years. ",
            "The number of nesting females on the beaches she studies is down more than 80 percent from when she first arrived there, Figgener said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. It\u2019s part of a global decline driven by a perfect storm of threats including plastics in the ocean, chemical pollution, industrial fishing, unregulated coastal development, and climate change.",
            "Figgener, 40, gained international attention when a video that she took of a sea turtle with a plastic straw lodged in its nostril went viral. The video helped launch a movement to eliminate plastic straws, which led to bans in Seattle and other cities around the world. But she says that\u2019s only a start. \u201cOur world, our oceans are much too complex to say that if we just stop eating fish or using plastic straws or what have you, sea turtles will be safe,\u201d she said.",

I\u2019d never seen a sea turtle nesting before. It is this ancient creature larger than I am that goes through a life program that they have been following for millions of years. I quickly fell in love with sea turtles and felt guilt, in a way, too. I mean they have been around for such an incredibly long period of time. Here they are on the brink of extinction because of us humans. I just felt \u2014 that cannot happen, at least not in my lifetime.",

We also have a massive problem with erosion [of beaches where turtles nest] due to rising sea levels.",
            "Nesting season is just now beginning here on the Caribbean coast. We are seeing one or two females nesting a night. When I first began my work here [in 2007] we were seeing 800 leatherback females nesting in a season. Now we are down to 50 to 150 on our beach. That downward trend is happening all over the world.\n",

Or in some cases the ocean would wash them away if they were buried too low down on the beach. So what we do is we put a little bag under the female while she is laying the eggs and we take the eggs to a more secure place to rebury them. We are careful to leave no track, so the poachers won\u2019t know where they are.",

But when we started pulling it out and snipped off a little piece, it became clear that it was plastic straw.",

We also have the problem of so-called ghost nets, nets that were lost or dumped and abandoned. Once a turtle gets entangled in a ghost net, they drag this big weight behind them.

In green turtles there is a type of cancer called fibropapillomatosis, which creates cauliflower-shaped tumors on soft tissue, like the eyes and the skin, and is basically triggered by fertilizer runoff.

            "Figgener: A lot of things came together in the favor of the Kemp ridleys. Back in the late 70s and 80s there were only a few hundred nesting females left in the Gulf of Mexico. These turtles often ended up in the nets of shrimp trawlers. In response, the U.S. mandated a turtle excluding device attached to the nets which reduced bycatch by about 90 percent.",

            "Some eggs were transported from Mexico to Texas where [a nesting colony was re-established at Padre Island National Seashore.] And there was a \u201chead start program\u201d in the U.S. in which eggs were incubated in a controlled environment and then grown until they were the size of a plate and no longer so vulnerable to predation as tiny baby sea turtles are when they are born.

            "In the wild, octopods are solitary animals that roam freely in the sea. They spend their days and nights catching prey with their eight arms. With their big eyes, they observe closely what\u2019s going on around them in reefs and on the ocean floor, tasting with their suction cups and changing the color of their skin to blend with their environment.",
            "For many people, such unique traits have made a Spanish company\u2019s more-than-four-year effort to raise octopods for food in factory-like conditions all the more horrific. In the farm planned for construction off Spain\u2019s Gran Canaria island, the animals would be kept in small, narrow cages stacked atop each other in a multistory industrial building. To kill the octopods, they would be placed in ice water at minus 3 degrees Celsius (27 degrees F). According to plans leaked to the BBC, the farm was designed to produce 3,000 metric tons of protein-rich meat from 1 million animals per year. ",
            "Nueva Pescanova, the Spanish company behind what would be the world\u2019s first commercial octopus farm, says it\u2019s addressing a growing demand for pulpo, protein-rich octopus meat, citing industry projections that global consumption will increase by more than 20 percent by 2028, compared to today. The company also claims that octopus farming could help conserve stocks in the wild.",

But the controversy raises far larger questions: What kind of relationship do humans want to have with octopods, which show the highest levels of invertebrate intelligence in the world? How intensively should we exploit them, either for food, science, or display, and how well are we protecting them?",
            "For centuries, humans have eaten octopods. But apart from their food value, the animals were considered so alien that they received only scant attention, even from science. In Europe, they were mainly regarded as monsters, rumored to sink ships. In the 19th century, Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cIf there are no limits to the imagination when it comes to creating something hideous, the octopus can be considered a masterpiece.\u201d But the more people observed and learned about these creatures in aquariums, the more their disgust turned to sympathy, even affection.",

People were taken aback when Billye, a Pacific giant octopus, quickly learned how to remove screw caps from jars at the Seattle Aquarium. After an octopus in Germany, which had become famous by predicting the outcome of World Cup soccer matches, died, newspapers around the world eulogized him. And in 2020, the Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher was watched by millions of viewers.",
            "Recent research has revealed that octopods can plan ahead, identify and remember humans individually, and solve complex tasks. Last year, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology showed that, just like humans, octopods have two very different sleep phases, one deep and one with increased bodily activity. Researchers even posit that they can dream. All of that is quite remarkable for a creature that lacks a spine and is more closely related to ants, slugs, and worms than to vertebrates. ",
            "Biologists know of about 300 species of octopods, inhabiting many different parts of the ocean, from coastal lagoons to depths of 5,000 meters. Some have a huge range, like the common octopus, which can be found in the tropics, subtropics, and in temperate waters. Some are extremely rare, like the roughy umbrella octopus, which is known only from a few locations near New Zealand\u2019s Chatham Islands.",
            "BQIn 2022, the British government included octopods in the list of \u201csentient beings\u201d of its Animal Welfare Act.",
            "Apart from their body architecture, almost all octopods share a predatory and solitary lifestyle (social octopods have been observed in just a few small colonies off Australia, Japan, and Nicaragua). All octopods live for between one and three years, and after hatching their eggs, females die. Despite these characteristics, octopods show signs of intelligence usually attributed only to millions of years of intensively social lifestyles in mammals. Scientists are still struggling to understand how something so short-lived as octopods \u2014 which have no chance to learn from parents and peers \u2014 can perform its cognitive feats.",
            "When the scientist Nikolaus Rajewsky visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium a few years ago, his gaze fell on a dark, motionless lump with large eyes. The octopus and he looked each other in the eye for half an hour. The scientist felt strangely moved. \u201cOn the one hand, I had this animal without a spine in front of me, a relative of snails,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand on the other, there was a real individual communicating with me as a human being.\u201d",
            "The encounter left a deep impression. \u201cI often think about that moment,\u201d says Rajewsky, who heads the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, where he studies gene regulation and, more recently, octopus intelligence. In 2022, Rajewsky published a paper suggesting that the parallels between mammalian and octopod brains lie in their genetic programming \u2014 which is curious, because their last common ancestor, a primitive wormlike animal, lived more than 500 million years ago. But in their brain cells, cephalopods have mechanisms \u2014 called microRNAs \u2014 that are considered a prerequisite for intelligent behavior in mammals, too.",

            "Such discoveries drive a fairly young movement to increase the protection of octopods, from research labs to the depths of the oceans. In 2022, the British government included octopods in the list of \u201csentient beings\u201d of its Animal Welfare Act, according them a status like vertebrates. And in September 2023, the U.S. National Institutes of Health asked the public for input on new rules for how cephalopods \u2014 a group that includes nautiluses, squid, and cuttlefish \u2014 could be treated better in research labs.",
            "This increased level of concern is in stark contrast to how octopods are dealt with in fisheries. Between 350,000 and 500,000 tons of between 20 and 100 different species of octopods are caught each year for human consumption, up from about 100,000 tons in the early 1970s, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n",
            "Octopods are often taken as bycatch in industrial-scale fishing operations, but they are not discarded, due to their monetary value. In more artisanal fisheries, especially along coastlines in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Portugal, they are the main target. Hunters go after the animals with traps that simulate safe hiding spaces. Spears are sometimes used in East Africa. In coastal communities, octopods can be an important source of protein and \u201ca crucial resource for the livelihoods of vulnerable people,\u201d according to Sustainable Fisheries, a U.S.-based NGO.",
            "BQThe FAO warns that \u201cglobal octopus landings have been on a declining trend for several years.\u201d",
            "But experts are deeply worried about the lack of an international management system and, in many parts of the world, coordinated catch restrictions. For whales and for some fish species, monitoring efforts lead to strict annual quotas, which are at least partly enforced. But for octopods, the global industry is in many circumstances running blind: they are harvested without knowledge of their species or reproductive capacity, according to a comprehensive assessment by a team of scientists led by Warwick Sauer, from Rhodes University in South Africa.\n",
            "For example, a study revealed that in a large part of the Atlantic, annual catches of the common octopus might have been five times higher than official statistics indicate. \u201cGlobal catch data for octopuses should be considered a very rough estimate of total harvest, and likely to be a considerable underestimate,\u201d the FAO warns.",
            "Along coastlines, national or regional rules may limit how often artisanal octopus fishers can go out to sea or set a minimum catch size to protect potential offspring. \u201cBut rules are only as good as controls, and in many areas these don\u2019t exist,\u201d says Daniel Oesterwind, a marine biologist with the Th\u00fcnen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries in Rostock, Germany, and a member of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council. Even the E.U., which prides itself as a champion of nature protection, so far has no monitoring and governance system in place for octopods in its common fishery policy.",

            "The FAO warned in late 2023 that \u201cglobal octopus landings have been on a declining trend for several years.\u201d The IUCN\u2019s Red List records octopods, with only a few exceptions, as either \u201cdata deficient\u201d or \u201cof least concern,\u201d but with the footnote that population trends are \u201cunknown.\u201d\n",
            "Oesterwind points out that projections are hindered by the octopods\u2019 short lifespan. \u201cThey reproduce only once, which leads to strong fluctuations, so populations trends are difficult to predict,\u201d he says. This is a hazard for their survival, too: \u201cIf one generation of spawners is entirely removed, the stock will cease to exist.\u201d In some parts of the world, efforts are underway to stabilize populations. Fishers in Asturias, in Spain, and in Western Australia have committed to following rules \u2014 regarding the number of traps used by fishermen, the minimum weight of catch, and the fishing period \u2014 for certification as a sustainable fishery by the Marine Stewardship Council.",
            "In other countries, local communities are managing their own systems. In the shallow reefs around the Tanzanian island of Songosongo, for example, the common octopus and large blue octopus live in small caves. Villagers have long used spears to bring the animals ashore. However, as octopods have increasingly been traded and exported, overexploitation has become a big problem. To address this, communities have started to manage the fishery collaboratively.",
            "BQRaising octopuses in confined spaces will lead to \u201cstress, conflict, and high mortality,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "\u201cYou sit together, discuss, and find a solution,\u201d says Modesta Medard, the marine program coordinator at WWF Tanzania. To stop the downward trend in stocks, villages chose a way that was as simple as it was effective: they began to close the reefs for three months every year. \u201cIt was part of the traditional knowledge that octopods always live in a home for three months, grow up, and then move on,\u201d says Medard. The periodic closures, which gives the animals time to reproduce and grow, proved worthwhile. The average octopus catch has increased measurably, and with it, local income. At the same time, the reefs and their other inhabitants are better protected.\n",
            "While there is consensus among octopus scientists that such projects should get more support and be implemented in many more regions, opinions diverge on octopus farming.\n",
            "Some scientists have joined the protest against the Nueva Pescanova project: \u201cOctopods should never be kept in large numbers in confined spaces. It leads to stress, conflict, and high mortality,\u201d says Jonathan Birch, who researches animal consciousness at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt is obvious that wild octopods lead a much better life than [octopods] fattened up in plastic containers to end up on our plates,\u201d says environmental scientist Jennifer Jacquet, of New York University.",

            "fCDemonstrators in Madrid protest against the planned Nueva Pescanova octopus farm last August.\nRicardo Rubio / Europa Press via Getty Images",
            "But octopus farms also have advocates in the scientific community. \u201cPerhaps this will help to better protect wild octopus populations and create an additional source of protein for us humans,\u201d says Australian marine ecologist Zo\u00eb Doubleday. \u201cOctopus are prime candidates for aquaculture because of their high rates of growth and food conversion,\u201d Warwick Sauer and colleagues conclude in their comprehensive assessment of the group. They see the biggest challenge in obtaining a sustainable artificial feed that\u2019s formulated from vegetarian sources. Otherwise, octopus farming might simply increase overexploitation of fish stocks.",
            "According to reports in Spanish media in late 2023, Nueva Pescanova has yet to raise sufficient funds for its farm and is continuing to pursue its necessary licenses, but it has no firm start date. The company did not respond to requests for comment.",
            "One leading octopus researcher, zoologist Louise Allcock of the University of Galway, thinks that the debate about the Spanish plan calls for a broader interrogation. \u201cPigs are also special animals, they are among the most intelligent creatures, and yet we keep them in atrocious conditions,\u201d she says. This is why, in her view, the entire food production system needs to be challenged. The aim, she says, should be to \u201cswitch to a plant-based diet as far as possible\u201d \u2014 and leave sentient, wild animals like octopods alone to roam the ocean."

By the end of his probe into the supply chain of JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat processing and packing company, Marcel Gomes reckons he and his team at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based nonprofit Rep\u00f3rter Brasil knew more about the origins of the beef it supplies from the Amazon to the world\u2019s hamburger chains and supermarkets than the company itself. ",
            "With grassroots support from labor unions and Indigenous communities, he had mapped the complex networks of cattle farms responsible for illegal deforestation. He then tracked the often-illicit beef through JBS\u2019s slaughterhouses and packing plants to the freezers, shelves, and customer trays of retail outlets and fast-food restaurants around the world. When his sleuths were done, the fingerprints of forest destruction were plain to see. Six of Europe\u2019s biggest retail chains reacted by halting purchases of JBS beef. \n",
            "That investigation just won Gomes, 45, a Goldman Environment Prize. But sadly, he says in an interview with Yale Environment 360, when he went to San Francisco last month to pick up the prize, stores there still had tainted beef on their shelves. \n",

            "Yale Environment 360: Why did you choose to investigate JBS?\n",
            "Marcel Gomes: Well, Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest beef exporter. My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company. It exports leather \u2014 for instance to Germany, where it makes car seats \u2014 and biodiesel made from beef tallow. ",
            "e360: Can you describe how you tracked its supply chain?\n",
            "Gomes: Since 2011, Brazil has had legislation intended to improve the transparency of sources of supply of beef and other agricultural commodities. So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",
            "Then we put this information together with data on areas where ranchers had been fined for environmental violations such as deforestation, and where there were reports of modern slavery and forced or child labor. We also used satellite images to identify which farms had seen deforestation each year, and we tapped into data on the transport of cattle from those farms to the slaughterhouses receiving the cattle.",

So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",
            "Then we connected both ends of the supply chain, and called everybody \u2014 the supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, the traders, JBS, the public health authorities, everyone \u2014 to tell them what we had found and ask for them to respond. Several supermarket chains in Europe believed our findings straight away and announced boycotts just as our report was published.

Indigenous communities especially know about the environmental impact they are suffering from the deforestation.",

            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas. But in practice it is very easy to do, especially when you have several members of a family doing the same business. One brother can move cattle to the land of another brother, with no paperwork. Also, you can change the boundaries of your own land, for instance, by turning one ranch into two, one clean and the other dirty. Then you can just trade with companies like JBS from the clean part. \n",

By 2026, more than 3 million farmers will be raising irrigation water from beneath their fields using solar-powered pumps. With effectively free water available in almost unlimited quantities to grow their crops, their lives could be transformed. Until the water runs out. ",
            "The desert state of Rajasthan is the Indian pioneer and has more solar pumps than any other. Over the past decade, the government has given subsidized solar pumps to almost 100,000 farmers. Those pumps now water more than a million acres and have enabled agricultural water use to increase by more than a quarter. But as a result, water tables are falling rapidly. There is little rain to replace the water being pumped to the surface. In places, the underground rocks are now dry down to 400 feet below ground.\n",
            "That is the effective extraction limit of the pumps, many of which now lie abandoned. To keep up, in what amounts to a race to the bottom of the diminishing reserves, richer farmers have been buying more powerful solar pumps, leaving the others high and dry or forcing them to buy water from their rich neighbors.\n",

            "Solar pumps are spreading rapidly among rural communities in many water-starved regions across India, Africa, and elsewhere. These devices can tap underground water all day long at no charge, without government scrutiny.",
            "For now, they can be great news for farmers, with the potential to transform agriculture and improve food security. The pumps can supply water throughout the daylight hours, extending their croplands into deserts, ending their reliance on unpredictable rains, and sometimes replacing existing costly-to-operate diesel or grid-powered pumps.",

Irrigation watered the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d of new high-yielding but thirsty crops, keeping a fast-growing world population largely fed.",
            "But many systems have reached their limits. Rivers are being emptied, and new investment has dried up. So in the past three decades, hundreds of millions of farmers in hot arid regions, from Mexico to the Middle East and South Asia, have switched to getting their water from underground. ",
            "Boreholes sunk into porous water-holding rocks now provide 43 percent of the world\u2019s irrigation water, according to a study last year by the World Bank. Irrigation is responsible for around 70 percent of the global underground water withdrawals, which are estimated at more than 200 cubic miles per year. This exceeds recharge from rainfall by nearly 70 cubic miles per year. \n",
            "Monitoring of individual underground reserves is patchy at best. They are too often out of sight and out of mind. But a study of historical data from monitoring wells in 1,700 aquifers in 40 countries, published in January, reported that \u201crapid and accelerating\u201d declines in reserves were widespread.\n",
            "Scott Jasechko, a hydrologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found water tables dropping by 3 feet or more every year in India, Iran, Afghanistan, Spain, Mexico, the United States, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. \n",

But rather than calling a halt to groundwater withdrawals, policymakers are upping the ante by promoting solar power as a means of delivering yet more and cheaper underground water to fields. ",
            "The solar revolution on farms is happening with the best of intentions and is using a technology widely seen as environmentally beneficial. Farmers love the fact that their photovoltaic (PV) pumps do not require expensive and polluting diesel fuel or grid connections. Once installed, they can run all day at no cost, growing more food crops, or allowing their owners to expand their businesses \u2014 growing water-intensive cash crops, or earning income from selling spare water to neighbors. Many farmers also keep their old diesel or electric pumps to continuing pumping when the sun goes down.\n",
            "Development agencies and governments are equally keen. They subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, cut emissions from fossil fuels, and curtail growing demands on overstretched electricity grids. But the long-term downside of this solar revolution looms large. \n",

            "The crisis is particularly stark in India. The world\u2019s most populous nation \u201cstands at the threshold of a revolution in adoption of solar irrigation pumps,\u201d says Tushaar Shah, a water economist for the International Water Management Institute. The government intends to raise the number of solar pumps more than tenfold to 3.5 million by 2026. ",
            "The country is already the world\u2019s largest consumer of groundwater, with farmers each year pumping onto their fields an estimated 50 cubic miles more water than the monsoon rains replace. Unchecked, says Shah, solar power is set to make the situation worse.\n",
            "Sub-Saharan Africa could soon be on the same path. Shallow groundwater is present below fields in many places across the continent. But the cost of buying diesel fuel is prohibitively high for many farmers, and most rural areas are not connected to electricity grids. So, the arrival of stand-alone PV pumps is \u201ca game-changer for small-scale farms\u201d in sub-Saharan Africa, says Giacomo Falchetta, an energy and environment economist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. ",
            " There are already half a million PV irrigation pumps watering fields across the sub-Saharan region. But Falchetta calculates that in the future 11 million more could be deployed to irrigate 135 million acres of currently rainfed fields \u2014 an area the size of France. These pumps could supply a third of the unmet water needs of small farmers, who produce most of the food across sub-Saharan Africa.",

            "The main thing preventing farmers from accessing the free water beneath their feet is the capital cost of the equipment, which typically represents up to a year\u2019s farm income. But that may soon change, as costs come down.",
            "\u201cThe potential in Africa is large,\u201d says Claudia Ringler, a water specialist at the Washington, D.C.-based International Food Policy Research Institute. \u201cSolar power is a breakthrough technology. Barriers will be increasingly overcome, and it will transform agricultural irrigation.\u201d",
            "Falchetta reckons horticultural crops will benefit most from the extra water made available by solar pumps, \u201cdue to their high water requirement and high economic value.\u201d But that rings alarm bells. Even modest falls in water tables in the continent\u2019s many shallow aquifers could dry up wells that sustain many of the 255 million people living in poverty above them, warns the World Bank.\n",
            "Such declines could also wreck fluvial ecosystems sustained by shallow underground water, including the wetlands and rivers on which millions of Africans depend for fish and other resources.\n",
            "Overexploitation of groundwater, the World Bank review concludes, is \u201ca classic tragedy of the commons \u2014 with exponential impacts disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable.\u201d Yet the bank, along with its sister agency the Africa Development Bank, is funding stand-alone solar pump projects in Togo, Niger, and elsewhere across the continent.",

            "In many places, however, farmers may not be able to wait for subsidies or aid projects to embrace solar pumps. They have little choice if they want to grow crops as other means of pumping water to their fields falter.\n",
            "That is certainly the case in Yemen, on the south flank of the Arabian Peninsula, where the desert sands have a new look these days. Satellite images show around 100,000 solar panels glinting in the sun, surrounded by green fields. Hooked to water pumps, the panels provide free energy for farmers to pump out ancient underground water. They are irrigating crops of qat, a shrub whose narcotic leaves are the country\u2019s stimulant of choice, chewed through the day by millions of men.",
            "For these farmers, the solar irrigation revolution in Yemen is born of necessity. Most crops will only grow if irrigated, and the country\u2019s long civil war has crashed the country\u2019s electricity grid and made supplies of diesel fuel for pumps expensive and unreliable. So, they are turning en masse to solar power to keep the qat coming. ",
            "The panels have proved an instant hit, says Middle East development researcher Helen Lackner of SOAS University of London. Everybody wants one. But in the hydrological free-for-all, the region\u2019s underground water, a legacy of wetter times, is running out. \n",
            "The solar-powered farms are pumping so hard that they have triggered \u201ca significant drop in groundwater since 2018 \u2026 in spite of above average rainfall,\u201d according to an analysis by Leonie Nimmo, a researcher until recently at the U.K.-based Conflict and Environment Observatory. The spread of solar power in Yemen \u201chas become an essential and life-saving source of power,\u201d both to irrigate food crops and provide income from selling qat, he says, but it is also \u201crapidly exhausting the country\u2019s scarce groundwater reserves.\u201d",
            "BQFarmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing diesel-powered pumps, rather than replacing them. ",
            "In the central Sana\u2019a Basin, Yemen\u2019s agricultural heartland, more than 30 percent of farmers use solar pumps. In a report with Musaed Aklan, a water researcher at the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, Lackner predicts a \u201ccomplete shift\u201d to solar by 2028. But the basin may be down to its last few years of extractable water. Farmers who once found water at depths of 100 feet or less are now pumping from 1,300 feet or more.",
            "Some 1,500 miles to the northeast, in in the desert province of Helmand in Afghanistan, more than 60,000 opium farmers have in the past few years given up on malfunctioning state irrigation canals and switched to tapping underground water using solar water pumps. As a consequence, water tables have been falling typically by 10 feet per year, according to David Mansfield, an expert on the country\u2019s opium industry from the London School of Economics.\n",
            "An abrupt ban on opium production imposed by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers in 2022 may offer a partial reprieve. But the wheat that the farmers are growing as a replacement is also a thirsty crop. So, water bankruptcy in Helmand may only be delayed.",

            "\u201cVery little is known about the aquifer [in Helmand], its recharge or when and if it might run dry,\u201d according to Mansfield. But if their pumps run dry, many of the million-plus people in the desert province could be left destitute, as this vital desert resource \u2014 the legacy of rainfall in wetter times \u2014 disappears for good.",
            "\nEven the potential climate benefits of solar pumping may prove illusory, says the World Bank\u2019s Balasubramanya. In theory, switching from diesel or electricity to PV pumping should eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. But in practice, farmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing pumps, rather than replacing them. And, however it is pumped, the extra water available will also encourage farmers to adopt more intensive farming methods, using more fertilizer and machinery to grow thirstier cash crops, increasing the carbon footprint of the farm. ",
            "What is to be done? Groundwaters are notoriously hard to police. India\u2019s overpumping has been \u201ca colossal anarchy,\u201d says Shah. Some states have attempted to control non-solar pumps that run on grid electricity by restricting power supplies to farmers to a few hours every day. It had some effect, says Shah, who first proposed the idea. But many farmers responded by buying more powerful pumps.",
            "BQWhatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "Now, to combat the excesses of solar pumps, Gujarat state has been paying some farmers high prices to use their PV panels to send power to the grid, rather than pump water, making solar energy in effect a new cash crop.",
            "The pilot project was limited to just 4,300 wells, and again the benefit was \u201cmuted,\u201d says Shah. He believes a better designed scheme could work. But Balasubramanya, who until recently worked with Shah in India, is doubtful. She warns that it might simply encourage more farmers to invest in solar panels, which could end up increasing water pumping further. \n",
            "In any case, controls based around the electricity grid will not work in rural Africa, where there is rarely any grid for farmers to either tap into or supply.",
            "None of this should be seen as a condemnation of solar power, says Balasubramanya. \u201cThe fundamental problem is not the solar technology itself.\u201d Whatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "But Balasubramanya says technology could come to the rescue. If PV pumps had to be sold with sensors that allowed monitoring of their output, then regulators could directly limit their use. Whether governments would do that in practice, given the conflicting priorities between immediate food production and longer-term management of water, is another matter."

It swirled over southern Mozambique and Zimbabwe, re-intensified over the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, then returned to strike northern Mozambique and Malawi.",
            "In Malawi\u2019s densely populated southern region, Cyclone Freddy dropped six months\u2019 worth of rainfall in six days, triggering floods and mudslides that killed more than 1,200 people and displaced 659,000.

The country experiences distinct wet and dry seasons, so climate phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o can disrupt normal rain patterns and lead to periods of drought.

Soil erosion diminishes soil fertility and can lead to decreased crop yields. Some of the affected households have had to wait for another farming season to grow food.\u201d",
            "Many of those affected by Cyclone Freddy still lack a reliable source of food or income, and low agricultural output has also led to food shortages and increased prices nationwide. The price of maize \u2014 Malawi\u2019s staple food \u2014 has quadrupled in the past 12 months, with a 50-kilogram bag now costing up to 36,600 Kwacha ($21.76).

In January 2022, Tropical Storm Ana killed 46 people, and more than 190,000 lost or fled their homes. Six weeks later, Cyclone Gombe killed seven people. As stormwaters spread human waste into lakes and wells, Malawi\u2019s ongoing cholera outbreak, the largest in the nation\u2019s history, worsened.",
            "Rural villages, including Mwenye, were vulnerable to disease and disruption long before Freddy hit. More than half the nation lives in poverty, and one-fifth live in extreme poverty, which forces people to make high-risk decisions. According to the WFP, approximately 73 percent of Malawians live in areas prone to climate-related disasters, including floods, drought, cyclones, and windstorms. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to afford a plot or rent a house, so poverty is leading people to settle in hazardous places,\u201d says Miriam Joshua, an associate professor of geography and earth sciences at Malawi University. \u201cThey are afraid of moving to [safer] areas where there may be no livelihood.\u201d For the same reason, early warning systems \u2014 which do not always reach the most rural areas \u2014 have had little impact.",
            "Sitting on the banks of a river that runs off the base of a mountain, Manja Village, in Machinga District, has always been flood prone. It\u2019s also a place where poverty, land degradation, and agricultural dependency have compounded residents\u2019 risk.",

            "But this has led to massive deforestation: by 1992, Malawi had lost more than half its forests, and it now loses an additional 0.63 percent annually.

            "Enrico Scoccimarro, a senior scientist at the Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change (CMCC), has warned that a warmer climate will cause tropical storms to become more severe as ocean temperatures rise. \u201cA higher availability of energy in the ocean leads to more intense storms,\u201d Scoccimarro told the CMCC\u2019s Foresight magazine. \u201cMoreover, if a storm happens to go back to the ocean, it has a higher probability to re-strengthen and hit land again, and this is just what happened with Freddy recently.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe southern part [of Malawi] lies in the area where cyclones usually pass and the Coriolis effect is stronger,\u201d says Lucy Mtilatila, director of Malawi\u2019s Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services. \u201cSea temperatures are also increasing, creating opportunities for more and stronger cyclones.

            "Of course, massive investment in response and recovery would mitigate the impacts of these events, but Malawi is a poor nation. The government predicts that climate change, in a business-as usual-scenario, could result in a 20 percent loss of GDP by 2040; meanwhile, the population is projected to almost double by 2050.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know what we should do,\u201d says Chipiliro Raymond Khamula, a spokesperson for Malawi\u2019s Department of Disaster Management Affairs. \u201cThere are many disaster risk reduction interventions that should be implemented, [including] early-warning systems, reforestation, and relocation programs.\u201d The major challenge has been funding. \u201cThe country will require at least $1.9 billion to reduce risks, recover, and build resilience,\u201d Khamula says.",
            "Clearly, preserving and adapting Malawi\u2019s food systems must be a priority if the nation is to withstand the crippling impacts of climate change. This, at least, can be done at a lower cost.\n",

He now grows peas between rows of maize, which increases yields during periods of high rainfall and reduces soil nutrient loss. Instead of using chemical fertilizer, whose price soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Jumpha uses compost and manure, which improves water retention during the dry season. Though he still struggles with the impacts of flooding, Jumpha continues to make a living and even harvests throughout the dry season, when most smallholders cannot.",
            "Farming methods like these are accessible to millions of Malawians and would be advantageous even without climate change. But most people never learn about these techniques, or they resist change. Subsistence farmers can\u2019t be expected to break free from centuries of convention, experts say, without structural support like training, subsidies, and incentives.",
            "NGOs currently provide some of that training, and in June, Malawi secured $4.4 million in funding from the Global Environment Facility\u2019s TRANSFORM project. Supported by the United Nations Development Program, the five-year project aims to reduce exploitation of natural resources, restore forests, and facilitate the uptake of alternative livelihoods, like mushroom cultivation and beekeeping.",
            "Such strategies are promising, but they have yet to reach the most rural villages. Helping Malawi\u2019s most vulnerable communities \u2014 which include people like Ellen Sinoya, whose land may be unproductive for some time to come \u2014 will be crucial for those recovering from Cyclone Freddy, and from the inevitable disasters of the future."

            "Stevenson: Decomposer fungi can degrade petrochemicals the same way they would break down a dead tree. And in doing so, they reduce the toxicity of these petrochemicals and create soil that no longer has these contaminants or has much reduced concentrations of it. They can also eat plastic and other things made out of oil, like agrochemicals. ",
            "e360: They\u2019re not picky eaters.",
            "Stevenson: They would probably rather eat cellulose, which is what plants are made of. But if there isn\u2019t any cellulose, and instead there\u2019s diesel or something that\u2019s essentially made out of carbon, they will find a way to eat it, applying their enzymes the same way they would if it was cellulose. ",
            "e360: You worked at industrial sites in Los Angeles that were highly contaminated with heavy metals: How did the fungus help there? ",
            "Stevenson: Unfortunately, most metals don\u2019t break down because they\u2019re not carbon-based. In nature, it\u2019s actually plants that pull metals out of soil. And so there are fungi, they\u2019re called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, that can help plants do that better. And so on Taylor Yard [the Los Angeles railyard] and other sites, I\u2019ve worked with a combination of decomposer fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plants that we previously found to be able to pull metals like lead and arsenic out of the soil into their aboveground parts. These plants can then be removed from the site without having to remove all of that contaminated soil.\n",

We had a very high success rate. In three months we saw a more than 50 percent reduction in all [petrochemical] pollutants. And then by the 12-month period, they were pretty much not detectable.",
            "e360: On these sites, you grew native plants that took up a fair amount of the lead and other metals that had contaminated the soil. But then the plants themselves become toxic, right? Do you just leave them there on site?\n",
            "Stevenson: No, you harvest them. You take a huge amount of biomass that contains these metals and either reduce it to a small amount of ash, through incineration, or sludge that contains concentrated metals, which can then be disposed of as hazardous waste or even reused. In some cases, you could extract the precious metals and use them in batteries and electronics.\n",

Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t solve the problem, it just moves it somewhere else, typically to another state with less restrictive dumping laws. It spreads a ton of toxic dust along its route, and [all that trucking] leads to emissions contributing to climate change.",

So I knew that all of those were things that the fungi could eat as well, and I basically layered them in with cardboard from the bike shop. Later, I added worms that would continue the process of breakdown by taking what was essentially a mycelium block that had grown on the rags and then turning that into soil.\n",

A former deputy mayor of her hometown of Athens, Greece, Myrivili had overseen a multimillion-dollar budget and a staff of 500 and was largely responsible for establishing that city\u2019s reputation as a leader in climate-change adaptation.",

They\u2019ve been working on sustainability, accessibility, equity, and how to make cities more livable, especially in the Global South, but climate change hasn\u2019t really been central.

Our body goes into a panic. The cardiovascular system is affected first, as it tries to move blood to the skin and to our muscles. But then a whole series of systems starts to have trouble. You can become dizzy or confused because not enough blood goes to the head, or you can go into renal failure.

            "Myrivili: The problem with cities is that we have a built environment based on concrete, asphalt, glass, and steel. These materials all absorb heat and radiate it at night. If night temperatures don\u2019t fall \u2014 in the Northern Hemisphere, at least \u2014 your body never really recovers from the daytime heat. It\u2019s the night temperatures, rather than the morning temperatures, that are the dangerous time.

We forgot that for centuries people found solutions for extreme environments, and we threw them out the window. We had internal courtyards with water fountains and trees.

We\u2019ve done pocket parks and created new spaces by moving and demolishing buildings, but also by putting green corridors in existing streets and taking away cars. Cars and air conditioners create more heat in public spaces. We need to create green streets, green corridors for pedestrians, electric public mobility, scooters, and bicycles.

            "What will it mean for policymaking on environmental and other issues, practically speaking, if the U.S. Supreme Court jettisons the Chevron doctrine?",
            "This question is on the minds of legal observers and environmental advocates as they wait for the justices to decide two consolidated cases in which the court has been asked to overrule the famous precedent that has stood for four decades. That ruling, in the 1984 case Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council, says that where Congress has not expressed itself clearly, leaving gaps or ambiguities in federal statutes, agencies should be allowed to adopt the interpretation they prefer, so long as that interpretation is reasonable. ",
            "The cases now before the Supreme Court \u2014 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless Inc. v. Department of Commerce \u2014 were brought by commercial fishing groups challenging a National Marine Fisheries Service rule, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. If the court decides to scrap the Chevron doctrine, it could have major implications for environmental policymaking and regulation on issues ranging from air pollution and climate change to clean water rules, public lands management, endangered species protection, and more.\n",
            "BQOverturning Chevron would reduce government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments. ",
            "There are two very different perspectives on the Chevron doctrine, which largely determine whether one thinks it ought to be overruled. Critics say that Chevron gives policymaking discretion to unaccountable agency bureaucrats, allows presidents to abuse their executive authority, and encourages members of Congress to shirk their legislative responsibilities. They charge that Chevron is \u201creliance-destroying\u201d because it allows policy \u201cflip-flops\u201d between administrations and that it cannot be squared with the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision, which ruled that courts \u201csay what the law is\u201d and established the principle of judicial review. If one believes that there is always a single best answer to how to interpret a given statutory provision, and that a skilled enough legal interpreter can always produce that best answer, then overturning Chevron has some intuitive appeal. Why ever defer to an agency when judges can just decide? ",
            "Supporters of Chevron contest each of these claims. Congress inevitably leaves certain interpretive question unresolved, they say, which means that some statutory provisions are capable of different understandings. And democratically elected presidents charged with executing the law are entitled to use this ambiguity to advance their policy preferences. (This is otherwise known as the \u201celections have consequences\u201d argument.) They would note that agencies are amply accountable to multiple overseers and restricted by many legal, political, and institutional constraints. And they would reject the idea that Chevron is somehow responsible for legislative shirking or gridlock and point to House and Senate rules that make passing legislation exceedingly difficult, along with hyper-partisanship. While accepting that judicial review is legitimate and necessary, they would also say that nothing in the Constitution requires courts to decide all legal questions with no deference to expert regulators.",

            "fCA fishing vessel in Cape May, New Jersey, named in the court case brought by fishing groups against a federal fisheries rule. \n\n\nRachel Wisniewski / Bloomberg via Getty Images",
            "To the claim that there is one discernible \u201cbest\u201d answer to every hard question of statutory interpretation, they would say no, sometimes Congress has not been clear (whether because political compromise requires some degree of unclarity; or because Congress is not prescient; or intentionally wishes to leave agencies room to adapt to change; or because of the limits of language), and there is more than one arguably best answer. From this point of view, Chevron is a sensible default rule of decision. It keeps courts from substituting their judgments for an agency\u2019s \u2014 and that is how it should be, since the agency charged with day-to-day implementation will better know what is reasonable in the run-of-the-mill case. ",
            "I support the defense of Chevron, as my past writings have made clear. Overturning or enfeebling Chevron would have negative consequences. It would further concentrate power in the judiciary; reduce the government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments, as well as to social and economic change; sow disruption and disorder in the lower courts; and undermine the regulatory stability on which the normal course of business depends. For example, courts rather than agencies would decide what pollution standards are \u201crequisite to protect the public health\u201d and allow for an \u201cadequate margin of safety,\u201d as the Environmental Protection Agency is mandated to do; what it means for an upwind state to \u201ccontribute significantly\u201d to the failure of downwind states to meet national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act; and whether \u201charm\u201d to an endangered species is limited to direct applications of force or can include habitat destruction.",
            "BQIf Chevron is abandoned, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read a statute.",
            "First, overturning Chevron would shift substantial power to the judiciary to have the last word on many important questions of policy that arise under federal law. It is more democratic for interpretive decisions, which inevitably involve policy discretion, to be made by agencies \u2014 which are part of an executive branch headed by an elected president, and subject to ongoing oversight by Congress \u2014 rather than by unelected judges. Deciding what qualifies as the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d or whether implementing an offshore drilling plan would \u201cprobably cause serious harm or damage\u2026 to the marine, coastal or human environment\u201d \u2014 as the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to do \u2014 depends on a combination of legal, factual, and policy determinations. Agencies have research- and information-gathering capacity, and relevant expertise in areas of regulatory complexity, that courts do not possess. They are also required to solicit, consider, and respond to comments on their regulatory proposals from industry and other stakeholders, including states. Companies and their trade associations can and do weigh in through this process to shape rules that affect them, and to require agencies to explain themselves.",
            "*Justice_Amy_Coney_Barrett_has_suggested_overturning_the_Chevron_doctrine_could_lead_to_a_flood_of_li",
            "fCJustice Amy Coney Barrett has suggested overturning the Chevron doctrine could lead to a flood of litigation. \nTom Williams / CQ Roll Call via AP Images",
            "Some of the conservative justices have implied that overturning Chevron is necessary to protect congressional prerogatives and restore Congress to its rightful role in our separation of powers scheme. Yet Congress already has the means to constrain agency overreach and check the president\u2019s executive power. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress has required agencies to provide advance notice of their rules and can effectively cancel any rule before it takes legal effect through a fast-track, filibuster-proof process requiring only a majority vote. Congress can also make its wishes known in the annual appropriations process and can defund agency initiatives of which it disapproves. If anything, abandoning Chevron would make the presumed separation of powers imbalance worse, not better \u2014 Congress could still use vague language to avoid making hard policy choices, only now those policy choices would be made by courts.",
            "Second, without Chevron, it will be harder for agencies to adapt regulation to new circumstances, something we should want government to do. Under Chevron, agencies can consider the latest scientific advances and technology developments; re-examine costs and benefits; consult with stakeholders; and consider the president\u2019s policy preferences too, knowing that the next administration may adopt a different view \u2014 in which case the agency would then bear the burden of explaining to the public and the courts why that new understanding is also reasonable. But without Chevron, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read the statute, not only now but for all time, making it more difficult for a later administration to change its mind given new information or unforeseen conditions. Eliminating flexibility will not improve regulation. It will rigidify it and prevent the government from updating policy over time.",
            "BQAgency officials are more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges.",
            "Third, overturning Chevron is likely to inspire more litigation and instability in the lower courts. Releasing all federal judges from any obligation to defer to agencies will invite parties to challenge many more rules \u2014 not just the most significant ones \u2014 and relitigate thousands of interpretations that courts have already settled. Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised this concern at oral argument, when she suggested that a flood of litigation might ensue over long-standing interpretations, where courts already determined that Congress was not clear and deferred to agencies.",
            "Overturning Chevron will also undermine uniformity and consistency in the interpretation of federal law. Chevron is a familiar and useful tool for lower court judges \u2014 they understand and know how to use its framework. What might replace it? The most likely standard of review the Supreme Court would substitute is so-called Skidmore deference, which is the amount of deference an agency is due in the estimation of the reviewing court based on several considerations \u2014 a standard that provides lower courts little guidance and maximum flexibility. As Justice Elena Kagan said at oral argument, \u201cSkidmore has always meant nothing.\u201d Without Chevron, judges will wade into often unfamiliar and technically complex statutes armed with their dictionaries, textualist principles, and canons of construction. They may or may not give any respect to the agency\u2019s views. This situation cannot help but increase conflicts among the lower courts.",
            "*Haze_hangs_over_lower_Manhattan_last_July",
            "fCHaze hangs over lower Manhattan last July.\nGary Hershorn / Getty Images",
            "This prospect leads to a fourth and related point, which is that overturning Chevron is likely to be bad for business. Of course, many conservative opponents of regulation believe that Chevron enables more regulation on balance, so they would like to see it gone. But there is a decent possibility that the consequences for business will be, at best, mixed. A few high-profile politically controversial rules will always wind up in the Supreme Court. And for those, Chevron will hardly matter because the Court will simply decide, as it has shown a tendency to do. But overall, Chevron is a stabilizing force because of its effect on lower courts. Without Chevron\u2019s default presumption in favor of government, it will be more tempting for many would-be litigants \u2014 domestic and foreign companies, state attorneys general, public interest groups, other stakeholders \u2014 to challenge agency rules, even those that many, if not most, companies might be able to live with or which they might at least prefer to uncertainty. Unleashing a cacophony of inconsistent rulings on what various statutory provisions mean, issued by up to 850 federal judges with minimal expertise in technical areas undermines the stable conditions necessary for the private sector to thrive.",
            "The Supreme Court may not overturn Chevron after all, perhaps in part because of some of these considerations. It may limit its application to narrow circumstances or impose new threshold tests on when it can apply. But it is highly unlikely simply to reaffirm it, which would be the best outcome for democracy, good governance, and business. ",
            "At bottom, Chevron embodies an inclination \u2014 that federal agencies ought to be given the benefit of the doubt if they offer good reasons for interpreting a statute a particular way, when no one can say for sure what Congress would have wanted to do. That inclination depends on a belief that agency officials are both more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges, so that in such instances, agencies ought to be trusted to make the call. Coming to that conclusion requires judges to at least consider that there may be limits to their prowess and to allow that when it comes to complex regulatory statutes, where legal meaning and policy discretion are often intertwined, agencies can be legitimate legal interpreters. That attitude represents a certain faith in the capacity and competence of government that it would be a terrible shame to lose."

            "Earth\u2019s Cretaceous Period is well-known for its huge, lumbering dinosaurs. But many smaller organisms were shaping the landscape at the same time. And the results of these battles can still be seen in today\u2019s woods and gardens.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "This period is when the first flowering plants appeared. Some insects developed a taste for those and other plants. In time, some plants found a way to fight back \u2014 indirectly. They recruited ants to fend off savaging beetles, flies and caterpillars. And this tactic, it now turns out, started before Triceratops, T. rex or Dreadnoughtus prowled the Earth.\u00a0",

            "Flowers ooze nectar to lure bees and other pollinators. In much the same way, many flowering plants and ferns secrete this sweet juice to recruit sugar-hungry ants. But this ant lure doesn\u2019t come from flowers. Instead, it \u201cbleeds\u201d from other plant parts. Called nectaries (NEK-tah-reez), these can take many shapes. Some look like a cup. Others may appear to be a bump on a stem. Some nectaries are so tiny that you can\u2019t see them without a microscope.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
            "In truth, the ants don\u2019t show up intending to defend a plant. They come in search of a nectar meal. Once there, though, they might run into a beetle or other herbivore munching on the plant. Ants may turn them into juicy snacks, or chase them away. Sometimes, ants will find eggs that had been laid on the plant by a predatory herbivore and evict them. \u202f\u00a0",

            "Researchers knew nectaries existed for a long time. They also knew that ferns and flowering plants both used them to bribe ants for their help. Suissa and two coworkers at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., wanted to know how long it took each branch of plants to recruit ants this way.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Another surprise came when Suissa looked at when herbivores evolved into lots of species. He thought that ferns would have developed nectaries right after insects started eating them. But no. Insects started nibbling plants long before fern nectaries developed.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
            "\u201cFerns are great at defending themselves in many other ways, not just with nectaries,\u201d Suissa points out. They already had other defenses, such as harmful chemicals, scales and hairs. Nectaries didn\u2019t become important for ferns until they moved into trees. That\u2019s likely when some ants came over, sampled the nectar \u2014 and started chasing off plant-eaters that weren\u2019t killed off by a fern\u2019s other weapons.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",

            "Archaeologists, take note. There may be brains hiding inside excavated human skulls. New data show that human brains can resist decay for at least 12,000 years.",
            "When scientists find ancient preserved brains, they often call their finds unique or one-of-a-kind, says Alexandra Morton-Hayward. A forensic anthropologist, she studies human remains to tell stories of the dead. She works at the University of Oxford in England. But as she came across report after report on preserved brains, Morton-Hayward started to wonder how rare such finds could be.",
            "So she and her colleagues scoured four centuries of archaeology research for mentions of naturally preserved brains. They found reference to more than 4,400 brains. They came from hundreds of dig sites.",
            "The researchers sorted these brains into five different types based on the processes that had kept them from rotting away. Some had been frozen or dried. Others had been tanned, thus preserving the organ through the same process used to treat leather. (This can happen when the remains react with chemicals found in bogs.) Still other brains had been saponified. ",
            "That last natural process turns some of their fats into a fairly stable soapy substance known as grave wax. \u201cIt\u2019s really disgusting,\u201d Morton-Hayward says. \u201cIt smells absolutely terrible.\u201d",
            "Nearly one-third of the brains didn\u2019t fall into any of these four types. In each of these cases, all that remained of the body\u2019s once soft, squishy tissues was a preserved brain. The team reasoned that some unknown mechanism had saved its tissue from degrading. The researchers also collected past and present climate information to learn about the conditions linked to each type of brain preservation.",
            "Brains preserved by the unknown process tended to persist for far longer than the other types of brains. The oldest one was 12,000 years old. Most of these specimens came from wet environments \u2014 sunken shipwrecks, the bottom of wells, lake beds and so on.",
            "The research was published March 20 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
            "Based on studies of soft tissues from dinosaurs and other ancient creatures, the team came up with a hypothesis for how the unexplored mechanism protects brains. Morton-Hayward now suspects that features of the brain\u2019s chemistry and how it worked during life preserve it after death. The types of proteins and lipids in the brain may be especially prone to linking up in a way that makes big, stable molecules.",
            "With the mystery preservation process at play, long-lasting brains may be more common than researchers realized. \u201cI\u2019d just love if other archaeologists were as excited as I was to go out to my next dig and gently rattle every skull,\u201d Morton-Hayward says.",
            "This graph shows the number of preserved brains of each type with different ages. The x-axis shows brains\u2019 ages in years, increasing from left to right. The y-axis shows the number of brains found preserved up to each age. This number includes all brains that are the age marked on the x-axis or older. (For instance, look at the data point for \u201cunknown\u201d brains at an x-axis value of about 7,000. It has a y-axis value of about 100.

The shape of the curve (the line that moves through the points) shows how the number of brains found for each type drops off with increasing age.

That\u2019s why Dominijanni\u2019s team designed it to be breath-controlled.",

It swirled for hours above Earth\u2019s northernmost magnetic site, or pole. Now, research has turned up parallel space hurricanes swirling high above the south magnetic pole.",

As they do, they churn up ionized gas \u2014 or plasma \u2014 in the ionosphere. This can drive flows of electric current upward, Lu\u2019s team suggests. Those flows then bend and begin to spin. That creates a cyclonic \u201ceye\u201d at the center.",
            "So those shifts in Earth\u2019s magnetic field are what likely set off a space hurricane, the researchers now argue. This, they propose, would be similar to the rise of warm, humid air at the center of the tropical cyclones that spin across Earth\u2019s oceans."

            "Earth does have its own gleaming green minerals. Some are even radioactive. But these minerals don\u2019t glow on their own like kryptonite. Instead, ultraviolet (UV) light gives these crystals their inner light. There are over 500 kinds of these minerals.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The glow happens because fluorescent minerals contain excitable atoms known as activators. When UV light hits these atoms, their electrons gain energy. The excited electrons jump up to a higher energy state. As they lose energy, they return to their former position. Some energy is lost as invisible heat. The rest is emitted as visible light.\u00a0\u00a0",

Shutting off the lamp stops the glow almost immediately.\u00a0",

            "Oil spills at sea pose risks to aquatic life and people. Every year, such toxic spills taint the water at more than 150 U.S. sites alone. Attempts to remove that oil tend to be messy, costly and often not very effective. But scientists in China and Israel think they\u2019ve found a new way to \u201csponge\u201d up that sticky pollution: cork.",
            "Past research had shown that cork could collect oil, but the process is too slow to seem promising. Treating cork with lasers speeds up the pace at which cork picks up oil \u2014 and only oil, reports Yuchun He. Indeed, the treated cork keeps water out. He works at Central South University in Changsha, China. This materials scientist was part of a team that developed the new treatment.",
            "His group described the process in the April Applied Physics Letters.",
            "The new finding \u201clooks terrific,\u201d says Nancy Denslow, \u201cat least in the lab.\u201d Denslow works at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville. There, she studies water contaminants that pose threats to wildlife. The materials don\u2019t cost much, she adds. However, she cautions, right now no one knows how well the treated cork will work on spills outside the lab.",
            "He\u2019s team stumbled onto the new treatment by accident.",
            "They\u2019d been using lasers to etch patterns into wood. They hoped those patterns might help them build electronic devices from the wood. They\u2019d never tried etching cork (the bark of a particular tree) before. But when they did, something unexpected happened.",
            "The cork darkened. That change suggested the cork might be photothermal \u2014 something that can convert light into heat.",
            "They already knew that untreated cork could sop up oil. But it did so very slowly. The problem: Oil is highly viscous, or thick. But oil gets thinner when it warms up. And thinner oil should more easily soak into cork or stick to its surface.",
            "The scientists had a hunch that tiny cavities created by the laser might help the cork store more heat. This treated cork should warm up more quickly than usual in sunlight. And that warmth should thin nearby oil, making it easier for the cork to sop up.",
            "One possible treated-cork oil spill cleanup approach is shown (top left). The laser created deep grooves in the cork that can trap heat (top right). Microscope images show pristine cork (bottom left), deep grooves carved in the cork by the laser treatment (middle) and a closeup of the grooves (bottom right).",

            "To test this, they compared small, thin slices of pristine cork to laser-treated cork. In the dark, both corks took about 45 minutes to sop up a mere two droplets of oil. With a camera, the researchers watched as this happened. Then, they repeated the experiment in sunlight and compared the results.",
            "In the sun, untreated cork needed 10 minutes to sop up the oil. Laser-treated cork took just two minutes.",
            "To simulate what would happen outdoors, they next poured oil onto water and watched it float. Then they added some treated cork and shone a sunlamp on it. Heat from the lamp warmed the oil, lowering its viscosity.",
            "The treated cork now sopped the oil up out of the water.",
            "The laser\u2019s light scuffs the surface of the cork ever so slightly, He\u2019s team shows. This makes the cork extra hydrophobic, or water-repellent. Those scuffs also make the cork more oleophilic (Oh-lee-oh-FILL-ik), or attractive to oil.",
            "The hardest part was testing ways to etch the cork, He says. His team had to balance the cork\u2019s oil, water and photothermal traits. \u201cWe need to continuously adjust these three properties,\u201d He says \u2014 to get \u201cthe best-performing cork.\u201d",
            "The treated cork is an example of something that is adsorbent. It can clean up a spill because the oil now sticks to its surface. (That\u2019s different from absorption, where the polluting particles mix with and enter a material.) \u201cUsing cork as an adsorbent can better separate oil and water\u201d later, He says. That should allow people to recover some of the oil so that it can be used.",
            "Oil spills can kill animals, plants and other organisms. Today, cleaning up a spill takes a mix of tools. Often, crews skim oil off the water\u2019s surface as they apply some harsh chemical that aims to break down the oil.",
            "Cork appears to offer a greener alternative. The new tests took place in a lab, so cork cleanup will need to be tested in real-world conditions, too \u2014 at sea. That can see if it works on a large scale and without harming aquatic life.",
            "He has high hopes for treated cork. It\u2019s renewable and environmentally friendly. After it\u2019s harvested from a tree, the cork (bark) grows back in about 10 years. So far, no one has tested whether the new cork \u201csponges\u201d can be reused. \u201cTo my knowledge, there are almost no truly reusable oil-absorbing materials,\u201d He says. But even if cork isn\u2019t either, it may still offer a preferred way to clean oil from the environment."

            "A full moon rising over the horizon, like the one shown in Figure 1, often appears to be unusually large. Many people will say that the moon gets smaller as it moves higher up in the sky above the\u00a0horizon. Actually, the\u00a0angular size\u00a0of the moon, which is about 0.5 degrees, is the same wherever it is in the sky.",
            "For comparison, the tip of your little finger, when your hand is held at arm\u2019s length, is about 1 degree. Angular size is measured in degrees, with 360 degrees equaling a full circle. An object\u2019s angular size is the angle between the lines of sight to its two opposite sides. For example, the angular size of the sky is about 180 degrees. An object\u2019s angular size is a measure of how large the object appears\u00a0to be, which depends on both actual size and the distance to the object. This example is familiar to everyone: an object that is near to you appears larger (that is, it has a larger angular size) than when it is farther away from you.",
            "What is the basis for this\u00a0full moon illusion? It is not that the moon appears larger on the horizon because it is seen next to things like trees and houses, since airline pilots flying at very high altitudes sometimes experience the moon illusion without any objects in the foreground. One well-supported theory is that your brain \u201cthinks\u201d the region of the sky overhead is closer than the region of the sky at the horizon, so it adjusts the size of the moon\u2019s image accordingly. Think about it: birds, clouds, and airplanes flying overhead seem closer than birds on the horizon do. When the moon is near the horizon, your brain miscalculates the moon\u2019s true distance and size.",

            "One way to explore this phenomenon is with afterimages. An\u00a0afterimage\u00a0is the image you see when you look at a brightly colored object and then look away. It is caused by fatigue of your\u00a0cone cells. There are three types of cone cells, loosely called blue, green and red, depending on which type of light they respond to best. When you look at a red object, for example, the red cone cells are preferentially stimulated. The stimulation of the red cone cells causes them to send a message to the brain, saying, in effect, \u201cthe color of the object is red.\u201d",
            "Prolonged exposure to a particular color can cause\u00a0cone cell fatigue. For example, if you stare at a red object, the red cones become fatigued and temporarily unable to respond. If you look at a white area after staring at a red image, you will see an afterimage that is the same size and shape as the original, but a different color. Try this by looking at the red circle in Figure 2 for 30 seconds, then looking at the white region to the right. Can you see the blue-green afterimage?",
            "Why is the afterimage blue-green? When you look at the white surface after staring at the red object, your eyes will essentially receive equal doses of red, green and blue light. But only the blue and the green cones are able to respond. Because of cone cell fatigue, the input from the red cones is missing from the region of the afterimage. So you see the afterimage as blue-green.",
            "The afterimage disappears over time because the red cone cells recover from their fatigue and become active again. When the red cone cells are active again, all three types of cone cells respond to the white surface, and you see the white region normally.",
            "How can we use afterimages to explore the full moon illusion? The actual size of the image on your retina, caused by staring at the colored circle in Figure 2, does not change. But, as you will see in this experiment, the perceived size of the afterimage depends on the distance between you and the surface on which you view the afterimage. In other words, the perceived size of the afterimage varies directly with the distance of the surface on which it is viewed. This relation is an instance of a more general perceptual relation, known as\u00a0Emmert\u2019s law, which states:\u00a0The perceived size of a particular visual angle is directly proportional to its perceived distance.",

            "Scientists understand much about Earth\u2019s structural layers \u2014 the inner core, core, mantle and crust. Yet there are still great mysteries to solve about our planet\u2019s inner workings.",
            "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth\u2019s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.",
            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",
            "Here\u2019s a primer on Earth\u2019s layers, starting with a journey to the center of the planet.",

            "This solid metal ball has a radius of 1,220 kilometers (758 miles), or about three-quarters that of the moon. It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",
            "*a_photo_of_the_Himalayan_mountains",
            "fCThe thickest part of Earth\u2019s crust is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) thick and lies under the Himalayan Mountains, seen here.",
            "Earth\u2019s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold\u00a0and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Many students study by reading their notes and textbooks over and over again. Research studies show there are more effective ways to use your valuable study time.",
            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",
            "*a_kid_sitting_at_a_table_studying_and_looking_really_stressed_out",
            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",
            "*a_photo_of_a_person_running_away_from_the_viewer_on_a_leafy_path,_zoomed_in_on_the_feet_and_lower_le",
            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "All of the metal weights shown here are made from the same material. But gravity is pulling the right side of this balance scale farther down than the left side. This shows that the total mass of the metal weights on the right side is greater. ",
            "In everyday life, we often use the words \u201cmass\u201d and \u201cweight\u201d as if they\u2019re the same. But in science, it\u2019s important to be precise. Mass and weight are both measurements that describe heaviness, but they actually mean very different things. Let\u2019s be specific!",
            "Mass is a measurement of the amount of matter in some object. It depends only on what type of atoms the object is made of, and how many atoms there are. Mass is traditionally measured in kilograms (kg). A pineapple or a wooden baseball bat each have a mass of about 1 kilogram. \u00a0",
            "If you were to measure out 1 kilogram of steel and 1 kilogram of feathers, they would each have the same mass. But their volumes would differ. You\u2019d need a far bigger volume of feathers because most of the elements they\u2019re made from are lighter than those in steel. It takes more of those atoms to build up the same mass \u2014 which takes up more space.",
            "People in the United States rarely describe objects using kilograms in daily life. Scientists and doctors use this term because it is the standard unit of mass in the metric system. (A standard unit is a definition that all scientists agree on.) \u00a0\u00a0",
            "You can change an object\u2019s mass by removing some of its parts. When you take books out of your backpack at the end of a school day, you\u2019ve decreased the backpack\u2019s mass. Mass can also change by adding more matter. When a child grows, their body is building longer bones and bigger organs. The child\u2019s mass will increase because they are transforming food energy into matter for their body.",
            "It\u2019s important to know that mass doesn\u2019t change by varying its shape, location or size. Your body\u2019s mass is the same when you\u2019re curled up on the sofa or when you stretch as high as you can. And it\u2019s the same when you\u2019re at home or at the beach or at school! But your mass is a little bit more after you\u2019ve eaten breakfast, compared with when you first wake up in the morning. Mass is a fundamental measurement of how much matter an object contains.",

            "fCAstronaut John Young bounded across the lunar surface during the Apollo 16 mission in April 1972. His space suit more than doubled Young\u2019s mass. The moon\u2019s gravity is so weak, however, that he could still jump easily.",
            "Weight is a measurement of the gravitational force on an object. It not only depends on the object\u2019s mass, but also on its location. Therefore, weight is actually a measure of force. In the United States, most people measure weight in pounds.",
            "Let\u2019s say that your body has a mass of 40 kilograms. Your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, on the moon, on Jupiter \u2014 and even floating inside the International Space Station. Your mass is 40 kilograms no matter where you are. But your weight differs from place to place because of differences in how hard gravity at each site pulls on you. On Earth\u2019s surface, 1 kilogram of mass is equivalent to 2.2 pounds of weight. So your 40-kilogram mass on Earth would weigh 40 x 2.2 \u2014 or 88 pounds.",
            "Language can get tricky here. Scientifically, you shouldn\u2019t say, \u201cMy doctor measured my weight as 40 kilograms,\u201d because weight isn\u2019t the same as mass. It would be similarly incorrect to say, \u201cMy doctor measured my mass as 88 pounds.\u201d However, since we all experience the same strength of Earth\u2019s gravity on our mass, in casual language we often use mass and weight interchangeably. In much the same way, most people feel comfortable describing mass in pounds and weight in kilograms.",
            "To avoid this confusion, scientists use a standard unit for force. It\u2019s called the newton (in honor of Isaac Newton). On Earth, 100 newtons of weight (a force) is equal to about 22 pounds. This is a measure of how hard Earth\u2019s gravity pulls on a mass of about 10 kilograms.",

            "fCThis photo of a nighttime launch of a space shuttle shows how big its engines and rocket boosters are. Rockets need much more power in the first few minutes after launch than they do later.",
            "As the mass of something rises or falls, its weight will change in the same way. And if the gravitational force on something rises or falls, its weight will also. In short, the mass of something rarely changes, but there are multiple ways its weight can change. \u00a0",
            "The gravity you\u2019d feel on the surface of a planet depends on its density. We say that Earth has the gravitational force of one \u201cG.\u201d The moon is much smaller and less dense than Earth. Its gravity is one-sixth G. Although Jupiter is much, much bigger than Earth, it\u2019s not very dense. So Jupiter\u2019s gravity is 2.5 G.",
            "If your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, your 88-pound weight would drop to 15 pounds on the moon. On Jupiter, you\u2019d weigh 220 pounds. On the International Space Station, floating in orbit, your weight would be zero. But your mass would stay the same \u2014 40 kg \u2014 in all of these places. For that reason, mass is a fundamental property of matter and weight is not.",
            "Rocket launches offer an interesting example of how mass and weight relate. At launch, the rocket is full of fuel, so its mass is greatest. At Earth\u2019s surface, it also feels the maximum pull of gravity. So its weight is heaviest. A few minutes after launch, the rocket has burned through a huge portion of its fuel. This means it has lost mass as that fuel has been transformed into energy. In addition, the rocket is farther from Earth\u2019s surface. Gravity therefore pulls on it with even less force. Both the rocket\u2019s mass and its weight have dropped. The rocket\u2019s engines can now push the rocket even faster than they could at launch. (Next time you watch a rocket launch, notice how huge those launch engines are!)"

            "Was the figure a ghost? In the mythology of the United States and many other Western cultures, a ghost or spirit is a dead person who interacts with the living world. In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, cause things to move or fall, mess with electronics \u2014 even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure.",

            "fC\u201cI\u2019d been hearing noises on the ceiling at the same time each night,\u201d says Clare Llewellyn-Bailey, who is now a student at the University of South Wales. One night, a big thud prompted her to grab her camera. This was the first picture she took. Other photos she took on that and later nights showed nothing unusual. Does this story make it seem like ghosts exist? Or is the glowing figure a flash of light that the camera accidentally captured?",
            "Ghost stories are lots of fun, especially on Halloween. But some people believe that ghosts are real. Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",
            "On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",
            "*a_wall_with_three_bricks_that_look_like_they_have_faces",
            "fCCan you see the three faces in this image? Most people can easily find them. Most people also realize that they aren\u2019t real faces. They are an example of pareidolia.",
            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo?feature=oembed",
            "This video was part of a famous 1999 study into inattentional blindness. While you watch it, count the number of times people in white shirts pass a basketball.",
            "Partway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the players. Did you see it? About half of all viewers who count passes while watching the video miss the gorilla completely.",
            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",
            "*a_woman_sitting_on_a_chair_looking_at_a_ghost_twin_image_sitting_in_front_of_a_window",
            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

That sleep now lost to early alarm clocks is vital for helping the body grow and heal from illness or injuries. The brain also loses out on time to process memories.

            "Some people have been using ChatGPT out of curiosity or for entertainment. I asked it to invent a silly excuse for not doing homework in the style of a medieval proclamation. In less than a second, it offered me: \u201cHark! Thy servant was beset by a horde of mischievous leprechauns, who didst steal mine quill and parchment, rendering me unable to complete mine homework.\u201d",
            "But students can also use it to cheat. When Stanford University\u2019s student-run newspaper polled students at the university, 17 percent said they had used ChatGPT on assignments or exams during the end of 2022. Some admitted to submitting the chatbot\u2019s writing as their own. For now, these students and others are probably getting away with cheating.",
            "And that\u2019s because ChatGPT does an excellent job. \u201cIt can outperform a lot of middle-school kids,\u201d Vogelsinger says. He probably wouldn\u2019t have known his student used it \u2014 except for one thing. \u201cHe copied and pasted the prompt,\u201d says Vogelsinger.",
            "This essay was still a work in progress. So Vogelsinger didn\u2019t see this as cheating. Instead, he saw an opportunity. Now, the student is working with the AI to write that essay. It\u2019s helping the student develop his writing and research skills.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re color-coding,\u201d says Vogelsinger. The parts the student writes are in green. Those parts that ChatGPT writes are in blue. Vogelsinger is helping the student pick and choose only a few sentences from the AI to keep. He\u2019s allowing other students to collaborate with the tool as well. Most aren\u2019t using it regularly, but a few kids really like it. Vogelsinger thinks it has helped them get started and to focus their ideas.",

            "This story had a happy ending.",
            "But at many schools and universities, educators are struggling with how to handle ChatGPT and other tools like it. In early January, New York City public schools banned ChatGPT on their devices and networks. They were worried about cheating. They also were concerned that the tool\u2019s answers might not be accurate or safe. Many other school systems in the United States and elsewhere have followed suit.",
            "But some experts suspect that bots like ChatGPT could also be a great help to learners and workers everywhere. Like calculators for math or Google for facts, an AI chatbot makes something that once took time and effort much simpler and faster. With this tool, anyone can generate well-formed sentences and paragraphs \u2014 even entire pieces of writing.",
            "How could a tool like this change the way we teach and learn?",
            "ChatGPT has wowed its users. \u201cIt\u2019s so much more realistic than I thought a robot could be,\u201d says Avani Rao. This high school sophomore lives in California. She hasn\u2019t used the bot to do homework. But for fun, she\u2019s prompted it to say creative or silly things. She asked it to explain addition, for instance, in the voice of an evil villain. Its answer is highly entertaining.",
            "Tools like ChatGPT could help create a more equitable world for people who are trying to work in a second language or who struggle with composing sentences. Students could use ChatGPT like a coach to help improve their writing and grammar. Or it could explain difficult subjects. \u201cIt really will tutor you,\u201d says Vogelsinger, who had one student come to him excited that ChatGPT had clearly outlined a concept from science class.",
            "Teachers could use ChatGPT to help create lesson plans or activities \u2014 ones personalized to the needs or goals of specific students.",
            "Several podcasts have had ChatGPT as a \u201cguest\u201d on the show. In 2023, two people are going to use an AI-powered chatbot like a lawyer. It will tell them what to say during their appearances in traffic court. The company that developed the bot is paying them to test the new tech.

            "Xiaoming Zhai tested ChatGPT to see if it could write an academic paper. Zhai is an expert in science education at the University of Georgia in Athens. He was impressed with how easy it was to summarize knowledge and generate good writing using the tool. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing,\u201d he says.",
            "All of this sounds great. Still, some really big problems exist.",
            "Most worryingly, ChatGPT and tools like it sometimes gets things very wrong. In an ad for Bard, the chatbot claimed that the James Webb Space Telescope took the very first picture of an exoplanet. That\u2019s false. In a conversation posted on Twitter, ChatGPT said the fastest marine mammal was the peregrine falcon. A falcon, of course, is a bird and doesn\u2019t live in the ocean.",
            "ChatGPT can be \u201cconfidently wrong,\u201d says Casey Fiesler.

She has made multiple TikTok videos about the pitfalls of ChatGPT.",
            "Also, for now, all of the bot\u2019s training data came from before a date in 2021. So its knowledge is out of date.",
            "Finally, ChatGPT does not provide sources for its information. If asked for sources, it will make them up. It\u2019s something Fiesler revealed in another video. Zhai discovered the exact same thing. When he asked ChatGPT for citations, it gave him sources that looked correct. In fact, they were bogus.",
            "Zhai sees the tool as an assistant. He double-checked its information and decided how to structure the paper himself. If you use ChatGPT, be honest about it and verify its information, the experts all say.",

            "ChatGPT\u2019s mistakes make more sense if you know how it works. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reason. It doesn\u2019t have ideas. It doesn\u2019t have thoughts,\u201d explains Emily M. Bender. She is a computational linguist who works at the University of Washington in Seattle. ChatGPT may sound a lot like a person, but it\u2019s not one. It is an AI model developed using several types of machine learning.",
            "The primary type is a large language model. This type of model learns to predict what words will come next in a sentence or phrase. It does this by churning through vast amounts of text. It places words and phrases into a 3-D map that represents their relationships to each other. Words that tend to appear together, like peanut butter and jelly, end up closer together in this map.",
            "Before ChatGPT, OpenAI had made GPT3. This very large language model came out in 2020. It had trained on text containing an estimated 300 billion words. That text came from the internet and encyclopedias. It also included dialogue transcripts, essays, exams and much more, says Sasha Luccioni. She is a researcher at the company HuggingFace in Montreal, Canada. This company builds AI tools.",
            "OpenAI improved upon GPT3 to create GPT3.5. This time, OpenAI added a new type of machine learning. It\u2019s known as \u201creinforcement learning with human feedback.\u201d That means\u00a0people\u00a0checked the AI\u2019s responses.\u00a0GPT3.5 learned to give more of those types of responses in the future. It also learned not to generate hurtful, biased or inappropriate responses. GPT3.5 essentially became a people-pleaser.",

            "fCWhen people open the tool to use it, a disclaimer states ChatGPT\u2019s limitations. Among examples: It may occasionally produce incorrect, harmful or biased information. Unfortunately, not all users will read or heed this warning.",
            "During ChatGPT\u2019s development, OpenAI added even more safety rules to the model. As a result, the chatbot will refuse to talk about certain sensitive issues or information.\u00a0But this also raises another issue: Whose values are being programmed into the bot, including what it is \u2014 or is not \u2014 allowed to talk about?",
            "OpenAI is not offering exact details about how it developed and trained ChatGPT. The company has not released its code or training data. This disappoints Luccioni. \u201cI want to know how it works in order to help make it better,\u201d she says.",
            "When asked to comment on this story, OpenAI provided a statement from an unnamed spokesperson. \u201cWe made ChatGPT available as a research preview to learn from real-world use, which we believe is a critical part of developing and deploying capable, safe AI systems,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are constantly incorporating feedback and lessons learned.\u201d Indeed, some early experimenters got the bot to say biased things about race and gender. OpenAI quickly patched the tool. It no longer responds the same way.",
            "ChatGPT is not a finished product. It\u2019s available for free right now because OpenAI needs data from the real world. The people who are using it right now are their guinea pigs. If you use it, notes Bender, \u201cYou are working for OpenAI for free.\u201d",
            "How good is ChatGPT at what it does? Catherine Gao is part of one team of researchers that is putting the tool to the test.",
            "At the top of a research article published in a journal is an abstract. It summarizes the author\u2019s findings. Gao\u2019s group gathered 50 real abstracts from research papers in medical journals. Then they asked ChatGPT to generate fake abstracts based on the paper titles. The team asked people who review abstracts as part of their job to identify which were which.",
            "The reviewers mistook roughly one in every three (32 percent) of the AI-generated abstracts as human-generated. \u201cI was surprised by how realistic and convincing the generated abstracts were,\u201d says Gao. She is a doctor and medical researcher at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Ill.",
            "In another study, Will Yeadon and his colleagues tested whether AI tools could pass a college exam. Yeadon is a physics teacher at Durham University in England. He picked an exam from a course that he teaches. The test asks students to write five short essays about physics and its history. Students who take the test have an average score of 71 percent, which he says is equivalent to an A in the United States.",
            "Yeadon used a close cousin of ChatGPT, called davinci-003. It generated 10 sets of exam answers. Afterward, he and four other teachers graded them using their typical grading standards for students. The AI also scored an average of 71 percent. Unlike the human students, however, it had no very low or very high marks. It consistently wrote well, but not excellently. For students who regularly get bad grades in writing, Yeadon says, this AI \u201cwill write a better essay than you.\u201d",
            "These graders knew they were looking at AI work. In a follow-up study, Yeadon plans to use work from the AI and students and not tell the graders whose work they are looking at.",
            "People may not always be able to tell if ChatGPT wrote something or not. Thankfully, other AI tools can help. These tools use machine learning to scan many examples of AI-generated text. After training this way, they can look at new text and tell you whether it was most likely composed by AI or a human.",
            "Most free AI-detection tools were trained on older language models, so they don\u2019t work as well for ChatGPT. Soon after ChatGPT came out, though, one college student spent his holiday break building a free tool to detect its work. It\u2019s called GPTZero.",
            "The company Originality.ai sells access to another up-to-date tool. Founder Jon Gillham says that in a test of 10,000 samples of text composed by GPT3, the tool tagged 94 percent of them correctly. When ChatGPT came out, his team tested a much smaller set of 20 samples that had been created by GPT3, GPT3.5 and ChatGPT. Here, Gillham says, \u201cit tagged all of them as AI-generated. And it was 99 percent confident, on average.\u201d",
            "In addition, OpenAI says they are working on adding \u201cdigital watermarks\u201d to AI-generated text. They haven\u2019t said exactly what they mean by this. But Gillham explains one possibility. The AI ranks many different possible words when it is generating text. Say its developers told it to always choose the word ranked in third place rather than first place at specific places in its output. These words would act \u201clike a fingerprint,\u201d says Gillham.",

We\u2019ve made these sorts of adjustments before. As high-school student Rao points out, Google was once seen as a threat to education because it made it possible to instantly look up any fact. We adapted by coming up with teaching and testing materials that don\u2019t require students to memorize things.",
            "Now that AI can generate essays, stories and code, teachers may once again have to rethink how they teach and test. That might mean preventing students from using AI. They could do this by making students work without access to technology. Or they might invite AI into the writing process, as Vogelsinger is doing. Concludes Rao, \u201cWe might have to shift our point of view about what\u2019s cheating and what isn\u2019t.\u201d",
            "Students will still have to learn to write without AI\u2019s help. Kids still learn to do basic math even though they have calculators. Learning how math works helps us learn to think about math problems. In the same way, learning to write helps us learn to think about and express ideas.",

She did not take part in the new work. But it\u2019s important, she adds, to understand how brains of these \u2014 and other animals \u2014 pull this off.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Fruit flies and humans look very different. Yet their brains are similar in many ways. So studying the flies could help researchers work out the basic biology of movement. \u201cOur interaction with the environment, other animals and fellow human beings [is] crucial for our survival,\u201d Chiappe says. And those interactions depend \u201cdepend on the ability of the brain to monitor and control movement.\u201d",
            "Researchers fashioned their mini treadmill out of simple and easy-to-get belts, pulleys and motors. Its overall length spans just over four times the body length of a fruit fly \u2014 about 2 millimeters (0.08 inch). To prevent the critters from flying away, researchers trimmed the flies\u2019 wings. A glass chamber coated with slippery Rain-X surrounded the treadmill. It limited the flies\u2019 ability to wall-walk. When the treadmill was on, the only floor available was a moving one.",
            "On the treadmill, the flies moved as they normally do. Most of the time, they quickly ran to the front of the treadmill. Then they stopped and rode its traveling belt back to the end. As their abdomens then nicked the back of the chamber, the startled flies sprinted forward again.",
            "\u201cThey sprint and then stop, sprint and then stop,\u201d says Brandon Pratt, a neural engineer on the Seattle team.",
            "The flies easily hit speeds of 50 millimeters (just under two inches) per second. That\u2019s the \u201cfastest speed ever reported\u201d for Drosophila moving on the ground, Pratt says. He\u2019s confident the flies can go even faster (though the researchers didn\u2019t thoroughly test this).",
            "Some of these flies proved to be marathon-level athletes, easily handling treadmill sessions pushing 90 minutes. Pratt\u2019s team posted its results to bioRxiv.org on February 24.",
            "As the flies ran faster, their bodies moved higher. They rose up on their tiptoes, or \u201ctippy-tarsi,\u201d as Pratt says. He\u2019s referring to flies\u2019 leg parts that move somewhat like human feet.",
            "The flies treadmills could be modified to have two different belts. These treadmills could force each side of the insect\u2019s body to move at a different speed. The flies\u2019 middle legs compensated for this odd arrangement, the tests showed. The flies adjust their step distances to keep moving straight ahead. This change in stepping is akin to how a fly might handle a sudden gust of wind from one side. They would turn into the wind by changing the stride on the opposite side.",

            "Fruit flies walk normally on a treadmill that moves at a steady pace on both sides (left). Flies can also adjust to a treadmill that has two different speeds (right). Careful analyses of stepping patterns revealed that flies\u2019 middle legs helped keep the fly moving forward.",
            "One thing the flies wouldn\u2019t do: Run backwards. \u201cThey like to run upriver,\u201d Pratt says.",
            "The treadmill doesn\u2019t allow scientists to record what\u2019s going on in the flies\u2019 brains as they move. That would be a valuable bit of data, Chiappe says. It could show how brain cells spring into action as the flies walk, run or adjust their stride.",
            "Other test systems allow more detailed glimpses into the brain of a moving fly. This includes spheres on which tethered flies can walk. But those systems don\u2019t allow the fly to move as naturally as the Seattle team\u2019s treadmill does.",
            "In addition to producing insights on movement, the treadmill experiments sparked some friendly competition, Pratt says. \u201cThere was a point where we were like, \u2018Can we find the most athletic fly?\u2019 We started going down a rabbit hole,\u201d he says. \u201cWe even did a side project where we did endurance training in flies.

He worked closely with the animals at Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut. \u201cEven as a trainer, I knew the shapes meant something,\u201d Richard says. \u201cBut nobody had been able to put together enough observations to make sense of it.\u201d",
            "From 2014 to 2015, he was part of a group that recorded interactions between four belugas at Mystic Aquarium. This footage revealed that the belugas make five distinct melon shapes. The scientists dubbed these flat, lift, press, push and shake. When interacting socially, the whales sported an average of\u00a0nearly two shapes per minute.",

            "fCBelugas appear to make distinct shapes with their melons. Four shapes are shown here. Top row, from left: flat, lift, press. Bottom row: push and no shape.",
            "It\u2019s not clear whether belugas make these shapes on purpose. It\u2019s possible the animals make them unconsciously when having different emotions. But belugas made 93 percent of the shapes when another beluga could see them. So Richard suspects they\u2019re likely purposeful signals.",
            "Shake and press are proving harder to interpret. \u201cThere are probably some [fine details of the shapes] that are meaningful to them [but] that are difficult for us to pick out,\u201d Richard says. \u00a0\u00a0",
            "The team confirmed its findings from the first four belugas in a larger group of captive whales. Fifty-one belugas at MarineLand Canada in Niagara Falls showed the same melon shapes as the Mystic whales.",
            "The five shapes described in this study may just be the tip of the iceberg, Richard says. Scientists have yet to track how these whales use their melon in the wild. It would be especially interesting to see how they move it during key behaviors, such as group foraging. Or when mother belugas interact with their calves.",
            "The findings establish a shared vocabulary for the melon expressions, says Malin Lilley. She works at Texas A&M University\u2013Central Texas in Killeen. Other researchers, she says, can now build on this as they work to decode beluga communication. Lilley herself studies marine-mammal behavior and cognition but did not take part in the new study.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/voj7Q6oM628?feature=oembed",
            "Two belugas at an aquarium bob their heads up and down, shaking their blobs of forehead fat \u2014 called melons \u2014 at one another. One of five distinct melon shapes that the whales make, \u201cshake\u201d seems to be associated with mating.",
            "Labeling melon shapes is key to understanding belugas, Lilley says. But it\u2019s also just plain cool to have words for the squishy expressions she\u2019s seen in her years studying these whales.",
            "Richard and Lilley are both eager to learn how melon shapes interact with belugas\u2019 voices. These whales let out a near-constant stream of whistles, chirps, squeals and clicks. That chatter has earned belugas the nickname \u201ccanaries of the sea.\u201d\u00a0",
            "If wild belugas make these kinds of expressions in murky Arctic waters, then \u201cthere must be important information that\u2019s being transmitted,\u201d Richard says. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a reason they spend so much time doing it.\u201d"

            "With a little help from the sun, blue jeans are going \u201cgreen.\u201d",
            "By accident, researchers stumbled on a new way to give jeans their iconic blue hue. The light-driven process could help dye denim with fewer harsh chemicals.\u00a0",
            "Denim is usually dyed with indigo. But this compound doesn\u2019t easily dissolve in water. So harsh chemicals are used to break it down into a liquid that can turn the fabric blue.\u00a0Each year, tens of thousands of tons of these harsh chemicals go into making denim across the world. Many are then dumped as waste into streams.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very toxic to both the environment [and] also the workers,\u201d says Katrine Qvortrup. She\u2019s a chemist at Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.",
            "Denim-dyeing chemicals can harm fish. They also pose health risks to workers who must use them. Formaldehyde is just one of the potentially cancer-causing chemicals that denim-makers use. So Qvortrup and her colleagues wanted to find a safer way to make jeans blue.\u00a0",
            "For their new dyeing technique, the researchers chose to use indican. It\u2019s the substance in indigo plants from which natural indigo dye is made. And unlike indigo, indican does dissolve in water. That means using it directly requires fewer harsh chemicals.",
            "In the past, others have used bacteria to make indican. But this only worked for producing small batches. To make enough for the big denim industry, the Danish team needed a new way. Their solution: Tweak an indican-producing enzyme found in indigo plants. This enzyme can make enough indican for factory-scale production, the researchers say.",
            "Their first idea was to mix indican with a second enzyme that would convert it to indigo. Then they dipped yarn in this liquid solution. It worked \u2014 the yarn turned blue within a few minutes.",
            "This sped-up video shows denim developing color over 40 minutes after being soaked in an enzyme solution.",
            "But the team also dipped some yarn in indican alone, without the second enzyme. A few of these samples got left on a windowsill in their lab. And to their surprise, these \u201cwere just turning blue without us doing anything,\u201d says Ditte Hededam Welner. \u201cWe were like, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d Welner is a biochemist on the team.",
            "It turns out that sunlight reacted with the indican on the yarn, converting it to indigo.",
            "How? The light turned a substance in the indican into a radical. A radical is a molecule with unpaired outer electrons, which primes it to bond to other molecules. Once turned into radicals, indoxyl molecules can bond with each other to form indigo.",
            "The team dipped more yarn in an indican solution, again with no enzyme. Then, they exposed the mix to various light sources. \u201cVery slowly, over the next couple of hours, [the yarn] will turn blue, and more and more blue,\u201d Welner says. \u201cThe light will develop the color.\u201d",
            "Light from the sun, from LEDs and even from household light bulbs can do this.\u00a0In fact, light can dye denim even darker than the enzyme method could using the same amount of indican.",
            "The researchers shared their discovery February 27 in Nature Communications.",
            "Using indican as a dye \u2014 with either an enzyme or light \u2014 would reduce the environmental harm from denim dyeing, the researchers say.",
            "They calculated the impact of each method using factors such as the materials involved, wastes produced and more. They looked at things such as carbon dioxide emissions and worker exposures to toxic chemicals.",
            "The enzyme-based method seems most promising. It could cut the harmful impacts by more than 90 percent, compared to normal denim dyeing, the scientists estimate.",
            "Light-driven dyeing is also less harmful than current methods, though not by quite as much. It might cut the impacts of dyeing denim by more than 70 percent. But the light method might take up less space than the enzyme method \u2014 and use less land. And if the researchers can cut electricity costs by dyeing with just sunlight, not bulbs, the light method may prove even better for the environment.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Using indican instead of indigo may be much better for the environment in some ways, says Robert Vos. He\u2019s a sustainability scientist who did not take part in the new project. Vos works at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But, he notes, the new dyeing methods still use lots of water. And this is a concern because a lot of water also goes into growing the cotton used to make denim.",
            "Both of the new indican-dyeing methods will require more testing before either can be used in factories. But at least cost shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Even with the cost of materials, such as LED lights, the light method may not raise the cost of denim dyeing at all, Qvortrup estimates. The enzyme method should cost only a few cents more per pair of jeans.",
            "That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to develop sustainable jeans [just] for the rich people,\u201d Qvortrup says. \u201cOur aim is to help to make it a cleaner process and not as polluting.\u201d",
            "Welner hopes these methods will have an impact even before they reach factories. Simply learning about more sustainable ways to make jeans may make denim-wearers think about where their clothes come from, she says. \u201cIf you want to wear blue denim,\u201d she says, \u201cbe aware that there are better ways to make it\u201d than are used right now."

            "In a humid coastal rainforest, a litter of pink, hairless babies snuggle with their mom. They stir and squeak for milk and drink from their mother until they are full. But these are no puppies or cubs. They are snake-shaped amphibians, far closer to frogs than to foxes.",
            "Mammals are named for their ability to produce milk. But scientists have found that a few species that are not mammals feed their young this way, too. These include certain spiders, fishes, cockroaches and birds \u2014 and now, snake-shaped amphibians. Ringed caecilians (Siphonops annulatus) are the first amphibians known to feed hatchlings a kind of \u201cmilk.\u201d Researchers reported their new finding March 8 in Science.",
            "Caecilians (Seh-SEEL-yenz) have many strange features. Rarely seen, they are burrowing creatures that are nearly blind. Some species, like the ringed caecilian, have poisonous slime and may be venomous. They feed their own skin to their young.",
            "Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, has been studying these animals for years. After hatching, ringed caecilian babies live with their mothers for two months. Jared and his research team found that the babies spent much of their time around the end of their mom\u2019s body. That\u2019s where there\u2019s an opening called a vent. It\u2019s shared by mom\u2019s reproductive, digestive and urinary systems.",

This happened up to six times per day. It looked like the mothers were responding to the babies\u2019 pleas.\u00a0",
            "The squeaking and begging is a fascinating observation, says Mark Wilkinson. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist in England at the London Natural History Museum. Adult ringed caecilians are thought to be sensitive only to lower pitched sounds, he says. So it\u2019s surprising that moms seem to respond to high-pitched noises from their young.",

            "This \u201cmilk\u201d is rich in fats, much as mammal milk is. This nutritious resource may help explain how the hatchlings grow so fast. They more than double their mass in the first week of life. Their only other nourishment is their mother\u2019s skin, which they feed on once every few days.",
            "Isabella Capellini wonders if the squiggly siblings compete for milk access. She studies evolution at Queen\u2019s University Belfast in Northern Ireland. Capellini is also curious about how the \u201cmilk\u201d production affects the mother.",

            "Unusual explosive eruptions rocked Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano repeatedly in May 2018 (including here, on May 27). A newly described type of eruption \u2014 like a stomp rocket \u2014 now appears to explain the volcano\u2019s novel activity.",
            "A never-before-seen type of eruption explosively blasted debris high into the sky from Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano in 2018. It wasn\u2019t one big ka-pow! Kilauea had been erupting lava. Then a series of 12 strange blasts occurred over a span of 11 days. These blasts sent gas, ash and rock eight kilometers (five miles) into the air.",
            "Scientists now liken those blasts to the action of a stomp rocket. That\u2019s a toy propelled from a launch pad as somebody stomps on a pocket of air, suddenly compressing it.",
            "It\u2019s unlike the two well-known processes that trigger most volcanic explosions, notes Joshua Crozier. He\u2019s a geophysicist at Stanford University in California. He also was lead author of the new study.",
            "One standard process is a sudden release of pressure as hot magma moves up pipe-like channels from underground. The magma contains bubbles of gas. As they expand, molten rock will blast out the top of the crater. Most other explosions arise when a rising plume of magma flash-heats groundwater pooled in some of the volcano\u2019s rocks. This will shoot steam and broken bits of rock skyward.",
            "But neither such process seems to explain what happened at Kilauea six years ago.",
            "Instruments near the volcano\u2019s summit collected data as it blew its top again and again between May 16 and May 27, 2018. Those data now suggest the strange sequence of explosions were due to something scientists had never noticed before.",
            "For one thing, the erupted material didn\u2019t contain bubbly bits of magma. That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from the first process, Crozier says. And rocks in the caldera were already far too hot to contain much liquid water. That eliminates the second scenario.",
            "Instead, it seems large chunks of the crater\u2019s rock fell down into the chamber of magma below. Each drop suddenly compressed air in the magma chamber. This must have sent volcanic debris shooting skyward, Crozier\u2019s team now argues.",
            "They liken this to the way stepping hard on the air bladder of a stomp rocket sends its foam projectile flying.",
            "Crozier\u2019s team described this novel volcanic action May 27 in Nature Geoscience.",
            "A falling of the \u201croof rock\u201d at the volcano\u2019s summit appears to have smooshed magma in the chamber below. Such a collapse of the crater\u2019s rock is known as subsidence. And this collapse didn\u2019t happen all at once. There were a series of successive drops. Each likely triggered another explosive burst.",
            "Almost as soon as the eruptions began, Crozier and others began suspecting these bursts traced to those collapses in the volcano\u2019s caldera. To confirm their hunch, the team pored over abundant data that has been continuously collected at the site.",
            "Kilauea is one of the most extensively instrumented volcanoes in the world. Networks of seismometers keep close watch on Kilauea\u2019s inner workings. Meanwhile, GPS-armed tiltmeters near its summit record subtle changes in the movement and slope of the ground. This tracks how magma moving below strains the rock.",

            "fCCameras at the top of Kilauea tracked its crater dropping. Here, the cameras show the widening collapse of the opening \u2014 or caldera \u2014 over 11 days in June. This was several weeks after the stomp rocket\u2013style eruptions had ended. Red circles mark the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, or HVO, and the Volcano House hotel.",
            "The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory also has a network of microphones that pick up frequencies below what the human ear can hear. These infrasound rumblings pointed to changes in air pressure. Some were likely caused by explosions.",
            "Changes in the frequency of infrasound waves moving through the ground revealed a distinct pattern during May 2018. They suggest the chamber would enlarge, after which there would be an explosion. Seismic waves, meanwhile, showed a series of distinct earthquakes. Each was less than a magnitude 5 in intensity. These, too, were linked to the explosions.",
            "What likely happened, the researchers say, is that the magma chamber drained enough to make its rocky roof unstable. This let that ceiling rock fall under its own weight. The falling rock suddenly compressed air above the magma \u2014 like compressing a stomp rocket\u2019s air bladder. Some 10 to 30 seconds later, cameras observed the summit shooting hot gas and rock up and out of the magma chamber.",
            "\u201cThis is the first time, to my knowledge, that such a mechanism has been suggested to drive eruptions,\u201d says Larry Mastin. He works at the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.",
            "Mastin did not take part in the new analyses. But as a volcanologist, he understands what can go on in and around magma chambers. What\u2019s being reported is \u201ca rather unusual mechanism,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut the circumstances of this eruption are unusual.\u201d And unusually good monitoring proved \u201cvery useful in helping narrow down the cause.\u201d",
            "The stomp-rocket mechanism only affected the very early stages of Kilauea\u2019s summit collapse, Mastin says. That was basically when \u201cthe roof [was] falling in right above the magma.\u201d Over time, as the collapse in the caldera floor\u2019s radiated outward, the tightly focused stomp-rocket compression ended. And that largely stopped the eruptions as debris clogged the vent in the central caldera.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Stomp-rocket-style eruptions probably aren\u2019t unique to Kilauea, Crozier says. The volcano\u2019s extensive monitoring just made it especially easy to detect the new phenomenon, he says. Knowing how to link seismic and infrasound data may one day help mitigate hazards elsewhere, he says \u2014 at volcanoes with far less instrumentation.",
            "\u201cIn many cases, the first sign we have of an eruption is a seismic or infrasound signal,\u201d Crozier says. The better that science gets at relating such data to what the erupting plume is doing, he says, \u201cthe better we can calibrate our models.\u201d And that, he says, could help warn of upcoming explosive risks."

The NSHM estimates the risk of earthquakes based on historical data and seismic studies. The number of people expected to be at risk by the new NSHM is about 40 million more than NSHM had suggested in models from 2018 and earlier.",
            "\u201cThis hazard model forecasts where we think the future earthquakes will occur,\u201d says Mark Petersen. A geophysicist, he studies earthquakes at the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. The new work also reveals where there\u2019s a chance of damage from a quake.",
            "The NSHM draws from data on some 130,000 quakes. That includes recent ones and some that happened long ago. It also considers data from nearly 500 active faults. A fault is a split in Earth\u2019s crust where rocks rub past each other. The NSHM also uses new methods that estimate ground shaking at specific places during a quake.",
            "All this new data revealed that, on average, earthquake hazards have increased across the United States. Petersen and his colleagues shared their findings in February in Earthquake Spectra. Their new map will help people prepare for possible temblors.",
            "A quake\u2019s energy ripples out in ground-shaking vibrations called seismic waves. The updated model is better at estimating the shaking of sedimentary basins, Petersen says. Those places have deep soil that can amplify seismic waves. That can really boost certain waves from a quake, causing more damage to tall buildings and long bridges. Accounting for amplified waves increased the hazard forecast for cities such as Seattle, Wash., Los Angeles, Calif., and Portland, Ore.",
            "But quake hazards aren\u2019t limited to the U.S. west coast. Or even to the places where tectonic plates meet. In the middle of the country, in southeastern Missouri, quakes sometimes rumble along ancient rifts in Earth\u2019s crust. And in 1886, a then-unknown fault near Charleston, S.C., caused a devastating temblor. It led to 60 deaths and damaged thousands of structures. The new map draws attention to the earthquake risks those more eastern states may face in the future as well.",

            "Some 3,000 light-years away, this white-dwarf star is pulling matter off a nearby red-giant star. When enough mass collects on the white dwarf\u2019s surface, the pressure and temperature will rise. This will trigger a nova blast.",
            "The next nova from this white dwarf is due soon. And it should be visible from Earth with the naked eye \u2014 but for only a few days to a week.",
            "\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\u201d says Gerardo Juan Manuel Luna. He\u2019s an astronomer who works at Universidad Nacional De Hurlingham in Argentina.",

            "The constellation Corona Borealis consists of seven stars in an arc. They looks like the letter C (toward the left in this image). In the night sky, they\u2019re between the bright stars Vega and Arcturus. Corona Borealis is visible high overhead on summer nights in the Northern Hemisphere. And it appears close to the northern horizon in much of the Southern Hemisphere. To find Corona Borealis, trace an arcing line from the handle of the Big Dipper to Arcturus (bright spot, bottom right). Then look for the semicircle of stars nearby to the east. The nova will appear just outside this semicircle.",
            "The white dwarf and red giant pair are known as T Coronae Borealis, or T CrB. It\u2019s a binary star system in which the white dwarf erupts about every 80 years. Its last nova\u00a0was in 1946. The next? It\u2019s expected by September.",
            "What led to this forecast? In recent years, T CrB has suddenly brightened. Astronomers call this a \u201csuper active\u201d phase. It\u2019s been followed by an apparent dip in the star\u2019s activity. This signals that\u00a0the nova is likely coming soon. The same pattern was seen before T CrB\u2019s novas in 1946 and 1866.",
            "This time, scientists plan to get a better view of the light show than ever before. Dozens of telescopes around the world and in space will watch T CrB. Together, they\u2019ll collect light from the star system at different wavelengths. These data could help unravel mysteries about novas.",
            "\u201cWe hope to be able to answer questions with this object that then might be relevant to all the other accreting and eruptive white dwarfs,\u201d says Jennifer Sokoloski. By accreting, this astrophysicist is referring to how one star is stealing mass from another. Sokoloski works at Columbia University in New York City.",
            "One big question is whether the white dwarf in T CrB gains or loses mass after each nova.",
            "Each eruption ejects matter into space. But some of the mass that the white dwarf has ripped from the red giant may sink into the small, dense star. This could cause the white dwarf to bulk up.",
            "If so, then repeating novas might one day lead stars like this white dwarf to undergo even bigger explosions. Such cosmic fireworks are called type 1a supernovas. They play a key role in how star systems and whole galaxies change over time.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s the holy grail,\u201d Luna says. \u201cAfter the eruption \u2014 say, in the next five years when things are calmed down \u2014 we should be able to measure the [white dwarf\u2019s] mass again. And see what happened.\u201d",
            "Another mystery: How will this nova\u2019s shock waves spread through the cloud around its red-giant neighbor. Researchers want to know, too, whether dust will form in this extreme environment. That could help scientists understand where the dust comes from that forms stars and planets, Luna says.",
            "Astronomers also will be on\u00a0the lookout for high-energy gamma rays from this nova. Such energetic light was\u00a0first detected from a nova in a binary star system in 2010.",
            "\u201cThat was a complete shock,\u201d says astrophysicist Justin Linford. He works at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. It\u2019s in Socorro, N.M. \u201cNobody in the nova community thought these things had enough energy to reach gamma-ray levels.\u201d",

            "There will be little to no warning before the eruption of T CrB. Scientists can\u2019t even be completely sure it will happen in the coming months. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll sit here holding our breath for the next 10 years,\u201d Sokoloski says.",
            "But if T CrB\u2019s past behavior repeats itself, then stargazers who find a dark place to view Corona Borealis at the right moment could be the first to see this cosmic spectacle.",

            "Ivory is so popular that poachers regularly kill elephants for their tusks. To stop the slaughter of these animals, most nations banned the international sale of elephant ivory in 1989. Those laws have not totally stopped poachers. But lasers might, scientists now report.",
            "Ivory is the hard material that makes up the tusks of several mammal species (both living and extinct). Selling ancient ivory, such as from a mastodon, is legal. So is the sale of elephant ivory that\u2019s at least a century old (if you have the right documents to prove it\u2019s that ancient). What\u2019s illegal is newer elephant ivory.",
            "Yet ivory from all of these animals looks about the same \u2014 at least to the eye.",
            "And that\u2019s proven a big problem. Poachers and other criminals can make lots of money from ivory. So many will lie about its source. The challenge for wildlife and customs officials is to know which ivory is which.",

            "fCSince a ban on the ivory trade, poachers have posed less of a deadly threat to African elephants, like this one in Kenya. But some sales of illegal ivory continue, often by claiming it comes from other animals. A new technique could help close that loophole. ",
            "At the University of Bristol in England, scientists have just reported a new way to flag the illegal type. They use Raman spectroscopy (Spek-TRAAS-koh-pee). This chemical analysis, which involves lasers, is good for studying stuff that\u2019s dense. And it\u2019s been used for decades \u2014 just not to find poachers.",
            "\u201cRaman spectroscopy is well suited to identifying differences in materials that look similar but have different chemical compositions,\u201d explains Eve Donnelly. This materials scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., knows that well. She uses the tool on human bones. She wants to see how they change with aging, disease or the use of certain medicines.",
            "You just fire a laser at the material. That laser interacts with bonds that hold together the sample\u2019s atoms. The reflected light reveals a \u201cmolecular fingerprint\u201d of the material, Donnelly says. And that molecular signal reveals the identity of the sample.",
            "Ivory and bone are similar, note the new study\u2019s authors. So they decided to see if Raman spectroscopy could identify an ivory\u2019s source.",
            "And it does, reports Rebecca Shepherd. \u201cWe can use it to tell the difference between different elephant species [and their relatives].\u201d That includes woolly mammoths. Shepherd, an anatomist, led the new study.",
            "There are other, faster ways to analyze ivory for its source, Shepherd admits. However, Raman spectroscopy has an advantage. It can be done without destroying the sample.",
            "Her team shared its findings April 24 in PLoS ONE.",
            "At the beginning of the 1800s, tens of millions of elephants roamed Africa. By the time the ivory ban went into effect, elephants were endangered with extinction. Today, their populations have grown to a little more than 400,000, according to the World Wildlife Fund. So they\u2019re no longer considered endangered. But ivory poachers still kill up to 15,000 elephants each year. These majestic animals therefore continue to face a threat of going extinct.",
            "Mammoths did go extinct almost 4,000 years ago.",
            "Remains from some of them of have been found in Siberia, preserved in permafrost. But global warming has been melting that permafrost. Today, people search the world for mammoth carcasses and their ivory.",
            "Mammoth ivory and elephant ivory look the same. And that\u2019s where the new technique can help. For the source of ivory, \u201cwhether living or extinct, we can tell the difference,\u201d says Shepherd.",
            "She says she plans to extend her research. She wants to adapt it to identify bone or teeth from other animals. Those include narwhals and sperm whales.",
            "She\u2019s also working with the World Wildlife Fund to explore how to stop poachers. She hopes the laser method will be integrated into portable devices that border guards already use to test ivory.",
            "\u201cI\u2019d also like to create a large database of ivory samples and have this freely available,\u201d says Shepherd. Then, a piece of software could compare a new sample to known ones. This should indicate how likely the ivory is to have come from an illegal source. \u201cIt\u2019d be a really good first test,\u201d she says.",

            "\u201cWe\u2019re basically running a giant experiment right now, in terms of what microplastics and nanoplastics are doing to us,\u201d says Michael Burkart. He\u2019s a chemical biologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He\u2019s also a founder of Algenesis Materials. It\u2019s a company developing a new plastic.",
            "Most plastics have been made from crude oil, a fossil fuel. Four years ago, Burkart\u2019s team at UCSD developed a new type. They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",
            "The researchers described the finding March 12 in Scientific Reports.",
            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",
            "Compost has everything the plastic needs to degrade: microbes to break it down plus water. The material also can break down in wet soil or the ocean.",
            "But the new plastic won\u2019t break down while you\u2019re using it, says Stephen Mayfield. He\u2019s a molecular geneticist at UCSD. He\u2019s also the chief executive officer of Algenesis Materials. To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "When microbes break down plant materials, such as cellulose, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. The researchers decided to compare the CO2 output of microbes dining on the new microplastic to when they ate cellulose.",
            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",
            "The scientists also coated a piece of fabric in the new plastic. After being mixed with the compost for two weeks, that fabric easily broke apart. Another piece of the coated fabric was not composted. It was still intact after two weeks.",

            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

            "Carbon capture refers to technology that tries to tackle climate change by capturing carbon dioxide, or CO2.",
            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

He works at New York State\u2019s Department of Health in Albany.

            "When I got into vet school, veterinary medicine wasn\u2019t popular in Nigeria. I didn\u2019t even know what veterinary medicine was when I saw it on my admission letter. I had applied for medicine, but I was offered a spot in the vet medicine program.\u00a0",
            "My parents didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d probably have good opportunities after graduation. They fought with me to change my degree. I went through the entire process of switching from veterinary medicine to biochemistry. All that was left was for me to submit the form.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "My experience with Skipper, though, got me thinking about what I wanted to do. I grew up fascinated with how an animal could be trained. I wanted to see how that could influence the lives of humans. I never submitted the form to switch programs.\u00a0\u00a0",

By the time I learned about how animals can help a person\u2019s well-being, I felt like this was something I could do as a vet and dog trainer. So I just jumped straight into [using] it to help neurodivergent children.\u00a0\u00a0",

But the stigma surrounding autism made it a daunting experience. Instead, we tried connecting with centers that work with these children. It took a while before any of them would listen to us, but one loved the idea. They offered to have us come talk to parents and stakeholders at an event.

            "That idea involving witchcraft doesn\u2019t hold any longer. But we still see the effects of it in our society.

The family might try to hide the child from the community and not associate with the child publicly.\u00a0\u00a0",

The main treatment in Nigeria and much of Africa right now is through accessible schools. The children receive therapeutic services and an education.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Scientists don\u2019t agree on how to count brain cells in dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex (illustrated). The debate is raising questions about how to understand extinct animals\u2019 behavior.",
            "How brainy was Tyrannosaurus rex? It depends on who you ask.",
            "Last year, the iconic dinosaur received the glow up of a lifetime. Neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel calculated that the fearsome reptile had 3.3 billion neurons \u2014 nerve cells \u2014 in just one part of the front of its brain. The discovery seemed to put the brainpower of T. rex\u2019s forebrain on a par with that of modern baboons.",
            "In fact, it suggested the ancient predator might have had the mental hardware to develop culture and make tools. But that claim raised some eyebrows \u2014 and doubts.",
            "A new set of calculations has now spat out a much lower neuron count.",
            "Dinos had closer to 360 million neurons in the telencephalon, this new study suggests. That part of the forebrain plays a role in sensing, thinking and coordinating motion. If true, this lower count would put T. rex on the mental level of crocodiles, not baboons. An international team of researchers shared the new count April 26 in The Anatomical Report.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Those new calculations don\u2019t convince Herculano-Houzel, who works at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. There\u2019s a \u201cfatal mistake\u201d here, that leads to the lower count, she says.",
            "To calculate how many neurons an animal has, you must know how closely packed those brain cells were. And that can be tough because neuron density varies widely across animals. Also, brain cells aren\u2019t well preserved in fossils. So when scientists study extinct animals, they must estimate neuron densities based on their modern relatives.",
            "And here lies the issue: T. rex belongs to a group of dinosaurs known as theropods. It\u2019s related to both reptiles and birds. But these two groups have vastly different neuron densities. Reptiles have fewer neurons per unit volume of brain than birds have. When calculating the number of neurons in extinct theropods like T. rex, researchers must decide whether to base their work on birds, reptiles or some mix of the two.",
            "For her 2023 study, Herculano-Houzel worked out the relationship between brain size and body mass for some 30 different dinos. She then looked at how these numbers stacked up against modern birds and reptiles. Using ancient bird families hinted that theropod brains were more like bird brains. Thus, she used modern bird densities to do her calculations.",
            "That assumption is flawed, even if birds are living dinosaurs, says Cristi\u00e1n Guti\u00e9rrez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. A comparative neuroscientist, he works at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. There, he studies the brains of different creatures. Birds vary in their ratio of brain size to body mass. So his team considered more birds that are alive today in their new study. That left T. rex\u2019s brain-to-body ratio closer to that of scaly reptiles.",
            "Herculano-Houzel\u2019s study also inflated the numbers of neurons another way, Guti\u00e9rrez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez says. She assumed that dinosaur brains occupied the whole braincase. As its name implies, this part of the skull houses the brain. But unlike modern birds, the brain of T. rex and many other dinosaurs floated in a fluid \u2014 much as do those in modern crocodiles.",
            "*T_rex_skeleton_and_braincase_in_blue",
            "fCT. rex\u2019s brain occupied about 30 to 40 percent of its braincase (dark blue). How many nerve cells were packed in this relatively small space is at the center of a debate on this species\u2019 smarts.",
            "Recalculating T. rex\u2019s brain size based on filling less of the braincase slashed the neuron count, Guti\u00e9rrez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez says. The estimate for the telencephalon dropped from 3.3 billion to 1.2 billion. Using reptile neuron density cut the amount even more: to between 245 million and 360 million.",
            "Herculano-Houzel counters that her study indeed accounts for dinosaur brains not filling the braincase. What\u2019s more, she argues, it doesn\u2019t make sense to consider the body-brain ratios of a wide variety of modern birds. For her study, she considered only birds that are most closely related to dinosaurs. She says that by throwing in birds like pelicans and penguins \u2014 which have very different body-to-brain ratios \u2014 the new study incorrectly concluded that T. rex was like modern crocs.",
            "In any case, whether T. rex had a lot of neurons might not be a good gauge of the dinosaur\u2019s overall brainpower, says Amy Balanoff at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md. An evolutionary biologist, she did not take part in either study.",
            "Even if the neuron density in T. rex was on a par with primates, the cells probably helped the dinosaur move its large body or gather sensory information. For instance, the smell centers of the T. rex forebrain were huge, Balanoff points out. Even if the telencephalon was loaded with neurons, many were likely devoted to processing odor, she says. And scientists don\u2019t yet have much evidence that these early dinos used their noggins for things like shaping tools or developing culture.\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "Guti\u00e9rrez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez agrees. \u201cHaving the same number of neurons as a primate does not make you a primate,\u201d he says. To suggest that these dinosaurs used tools or that they were as smart as a primate \u201cseems like a large leap.\u201d",
            "Still, Herculano-Houzel\u2019s work has been helpful. Balanoff says, \u201cI do really appreciate the original study for starting the conversation. You can\u2019t move science forward if you\u2019re unwilling to put the data out there.\u201d"

            "LOS ANGELES, Calif. \u2014 When Amelia Hammersley was in sixth grade, her younger sister went to the hospital after hurting her head in a fall. Her diagnosis: a concussion. That\u2019s a temporary type of traumatic brain injury, or TBI.",

People in China have used this native plant for hundreds of years to treat various health problems.",

To see if it might lower the dose of an NSAID needed to help the brain bounce back from a TBI, Amelia worked with an animal model: fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The same brain pathway promotes inflammation in both fly and human brains.",
            "She purchased a lot of fruit flies \u2014 at least 120. First, she tested how quickly each fly could climb a clear tube that was 9.4 centimeters (about 4 inches) tall. They were in search of a treat: moldy raspberry juice. The flies took a little less than a minute, on average, to complete the climb.",
            "Then, one by one, Amelia stuck each fly into another tube. It was attached to a spring lying horizontally. One end of that spring was attached to a plank of wood below. The spring\u2019s free end held the tube with a fly.",
            "Again and again, Amelia pulled the tube upward so that the spring stretched straight up at a 90-degree angle. Then she let it go. This released the tube holding the fly. As it slammed down onto a surface below, the fly got knocked against the wall of the tube. She did this four times for each insect. It left each of them with a TBI.",
            "Afterward, the teen again tested her flies\u2019 climbing ability. Most were now so disoriented that they took more than two minutes, on average, to climb up their tubes.

Another 30 got food laced with celastrol, also at 200 \u00b5g per ml. A third group of 30 flies received food treated with both naproxen and celastrol, each medicine at 100 \u00b5g per ml.

The other treatment groups fared better. Eight in 10 of those treated with both medications lived. And in the celastrol group, nine in every 10 survived.",
            "All survivors were given one last chance to climb up to a treat. The untreated flies took an average of 112 seconds to reach the treat. The celastrol group needed about 71 seconds. The naproxen group took about 54 seconds and flies given both celastrol and naproxen made the climb in 55 seconds. Those last speeds were similar to how they had performed before their TBIs.",

            "Writing things out by hand might seem boring and slow. But handwriting can boost links across brain regions. That includes some with roles in learning and memory. The new finding adds to growing evidence of handwriting\u2019s benefits.",
            "Scientists snooped on the brain activity of college students who wrote by hand or typed words. Compared with when they typed, more of the students\u2019 brain regions worked together when students scribbled with a pen. This trend also showed up in brainwaves \u2014 patterns of electrical activity \u2014 that have been linked with forming memories. That might mean writing notes by hand could boost memory of the material for a test, for instance.",
            "Previous research had shown that handwriting improves spelling and the ability to remember what you\u2019ve learned. Handwriting also strengthens the understanding of concepts. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives people more time to process material and learn it.",
            "This new study hints at why handwriting seems so good for memory. \u201cThere is a fundamental difference in brain organization for handwriting, as opposed to typing,\u201d says Ramesh Balasubramaniam. A neuroscientist, he works at the University of California, Merced. He did not take part in the new work.",
            "Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel are psychologists. They study the human mind at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The pair recruited college students for their new study. They showed students a word on a computer screen, then asked them to type or handwrite it in cursive with a digital pen. All the while, sensors in caps they wore recorded electrical activity in their brains.",
            "Brainwaves look like wiggles of electrical activity. The scientists examined the waves\u2019 frequency, which is how many times the waves pulsed per second. The team was looking for different brain regions whose waves were in sync. When those waves have the same frequency at the same time, it hints at how strongly the areas are linked while working on some task.\u00a0",
            "With handwriting, the researchers expected to see an increase of brain activity in areas linked to movement. But they also saw a boost in certain waves related to learning and memory. And when students wrote by hand, intriguing connections emerged.",

            "fCIn a lab, college students in Norway typed or hand-wrote a word they saw on a screen. The students wore caps outfitted with 256 electrodes to monitor their brains\u2019 behavior.",
            "Handwriting \u2014 but not typing \u2014 increased the link between the brain\u2019s outer parts (which play roles in moving and sensing) and central parts. Some of those central brain areas play a role in memory. The findings suggest these brain areas join forces during handwriting in a way that they don\u2019t during typing.",
            "The scientists shared their results January 26 in Frontiers in Psychology.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "Even when the movements are very similar, the brain\u2019s activity seems \u201cmuch, much higher\u201d in handwriting, Balasubramaniam says. \u201cIt shows that there\u2019s more involvement of these brain regions when you\u2019re handwriting.\u201d That could aid learning. That\u2019s because certain brainwaves that get a boost play a role in making and storing memories.",
            "The team did not test whether the students remembered the words they wrote or typed. So it\u2019s not yet clear how the increased brain activity affects learning, says Kathleen Arnold. A psychologist, she works at Radford University in Virginia. More study is needed on the differences in brain linkages and whether they align with how well people learn.",
            "Differences in brain activity could be due to the unique movements required to type or write, Balasubramaniam notes. \u201cBut that said, we\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are the first results to actually show that these two things have different brain-activation patterns.\u201d",
            "Handwriting may aid learning. But typing is often easier, faster and more practical. So students and teachers alike should decide, based on the task, whether to write it out or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help you hang on to information, while typing an essay could help you get ideas down to the page faster, before you forget them.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Though more work is needed to find the best strategy for learning, handwriting has shown its value.

            "The\u00a0law of refraction,\u00a0which is also known as\u00a0Snell\u2019s law,\u00a0actually applies to everyday life. For example, when you see your friend\u2019s face through the window, you\u2019re seeing light that is refracted through the glass. Snell\u2019s law describes what happens to the\u00a0trajectory\u00a0of a beam of light as it passes from one medium, such as air, to another, such as glass.",
            "As you apply Snell\u2019s law and the definition of\u00a0index of refraction\u00a0in this science project, you will be able to measure the speed of light in gelatin. The beauty of this science project also lies in how you can verify one of the most basic laws of optics, experimentally, by using readily available and inexpensive materials.",

It passes through the interface and is refracted to angle\u00a0\u03b82\u00a0to the normal. The first material has an index of refraction\u00a0n1\u00a0and the speed of light in the material is\u00a0v1.

            "Note that Snell\u2019s law not only applies to the case of the laser beam passing through air and gelatin, but also to other examples of how the\u00a0incident object\u00a0changes direction as it passes from a faster medium to a slower medium, and vice versa.",
            "For example, a marching band walks together in time with the music and takes the same-length steps. What if the band moves across a grassy football field at an angle, and as each band member crosses the 50-yard line, he or she suddenly finds the field very muddy and slippery? As a result, he or she steps in time but takes steps that are 20 percent shorter because of the mud. What happens then? Answer: Those who have crossed the 50-yard line are traveling at 80 percent the speed of those who have not, and the line of band members bends at the 50-yard line, just like light in this experiment. With a little thought, one can even compute the\u00a0angle\u00a0at which the line bends (actually the reverse of what you will be trying to do in this science project).",

In addition to understanding the theory behind the experiment, this project calls for some experimental design creativity and hands-on \u201cplaying time.\u201dThink about how one would measure the angle of incidence of a laser passing through the gelatin, with reference to the normal (the line that is perpendicular to the surface of the medium). Also consider how one could precisely direct the laser beam from the laser pointer (or laser level) at a predetermined \u201centry point.\u201d What type of mounting structure would you come up with?For example, the photo below (using a tub of liquid instead of gelatin) represents a clever setup. The laser beam was originally along the line between the tiles on the countertop (you could also use graph paper). You can see a bit of the beam exiting the laser in the center of the circle, and you can see the entry point of the laser in the plastic container. These two points show the original path of the beam, and you can easily connect the points to create the original trajectory. (Note that the normal, which is not shown, is the line that runs perpendicular to the side of the plastic container that gets hit by the laser.) Thus, we can accurately measure the angle here.",

            "Relatively few people have never had COVID-19. A study that tried to infect people on purpose \u2014 and in some cases failed \u2014 found a genetic clue to what may protect some of us.",
            "If you\u2019ve never had COVID-19, you\u2019re not alone. Others, too, have dodged the infected for more than four years. And some may have achieved this with some help from a newly discovered immune response. That\u2019s the finding of a new study.",
            "In that study, people volunteered to get infected with the virus \u2014 yes, on purpose. And some never get sick. Their protection now appears to be linked to the activity of a little-studied immunity gene.",
            "The new data suggest that people in whom this gene is unusually active can better resist infection by SARS-CoV-2. That\u2019s the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.",
            "This study gives the most detailed look yet at how the immune system responds to that virus. It works differently in some people, and that appears to help explain why some got sick with COVID and others didn\u2019t.",
            "Researchers shared their unexpected findings June 19 in Nature.",
            "Scientists in the United Kingdom conducted the study in 2021. It was at the height of the pandemic. They recruited 36 young, healthy volunteers. None had yet gotten COVID-19 or a vaccine against it. The virus was released into each volunteer\u2019s nose. This type of study is called a challenge trial. Here, it challenged the body by exposure to the virus.",
            "The first goal was to learn how much virus it takes to kick-start an infection.",
            "Sixteen of the recruits also had more extensive tests. Researchers tracked a wide range of immune responses in their blood and the lining of their noses. The team measured many aspects of immunity and at many points in time \u2014 both before and after someone had been exposed. The researchers hoped to uncover details of when and where different immune reactions begin.",
            "But there was a problem. Only six of the 16 got sick.\u00a0",
            "\u201cInitially, we were very bummed,\u201d recalls study leader Rik Lindeboom. It seemed \u201clike, we\u2019re wasting all these experiments on people that we didn\u2019t actually infect.\u201d A biologist, Lindeboom works at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam.",
            "But then his team realized it had stumbled across a \u201cunique opportunity,\u201d he says. Here was a chance to ask: How do some people exposed to the virus manage to fend it off?",
            "No one knows exactly how many people have dodged COVID-19. But by the end of 2023, about 1 in 8 Americans likely hadn\u2019t caught the virus. That estimate comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
            "Challenge trials are controversial. Some experts question the ethics of choosing to give people something that can cause disease.",
            "But \u201cyou can\u2019t underplay how valuable this kind of information is,\u201d says Jill Hollenbach. She studies the genetics of the immune system at the University of California, San Francisco. She did not take part in the new work. But she points out that challenge trials allow researchers to track people from the moment they encounter a disease-causing agent.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare,\u201d she notes, \u201cthat we get to see a snapshot of what\u2019s actually happening in early infection.\u201d",
            "Recruits in the 2021 trial who got sick \u2014 showed symptoms \u2014 developed a strong immune reaction in their noses within five days of exposure. This brought in high levels of certain proteins. Called interferons, they help signal a viral threat. This brings in cells that can go on to fight the infection.",
            "Those who didn\u2019t get sick responded either of two other ways.",
            "The seven who never tested positive for the virus had widespread, but subtle, changes. These changes affected immune cells called monocytes and MAIT cells.",
            "Three other people got brief infections in their nose. But their bodies quickly shut it down and they never felt sick. These people showed a strong immune reaction in their noses within one day of exposure. It brought in high levels of interferons \u2014 about the same levels as it took the sick group to mount in five days. In the people who would become sick, it now appears that those extra days gave the virus time to multiply and spread.",
            "A swift response at the site of infection may be key to preventing the virus from getting a foothold, Lindeboom says.\u00a0",
            "Another finding surprised his team. Interferon activity showed up in the blood of sick people before it showed up in their noses.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s the exact opposite of what we had hypothesized,\u201d Lindeboom says. After all, the virus was delivered via the nose.",
            "\u201cYour immune system is capable of sensing that something is happening,\u201d he says. It now looks like it may inform \u201cthe body \u2014 before the cells that are actually affected know about it.\u201d",

            "This Canadian newscast interviews scientists and others on what to make of the announced discovery of a gene that may help some people resist infection with the COVID-19 virus.",
            "Lindeboom isn\u2019t sure why some people who didn\u2019t get sick showed a brief infection and others did not. But these groups shared one difference from people who developed symptoms. It involved the gene HLA-DQA2. It turns on in specialized immune cells that help alert the body to invading microbes.",
            "Before exposure to the COVID virus, this gene was more active in people who didn\u2019t get sick than in those who later did. Scientists aren\u2019t sure exactly what this gene does. But earlier work by others has linked it to milder cases of COVID-19.\u00a0",
            "Perhaps the gene\u2019s activity helps signal someone\u2019s risk of getting sick, says Akiko Iwasaki. If true, she says, it \u201cmay be able to predict who is susceptible to infection.\u201d An immunologist at Yale University, Iwasaki didn\u2019t work on the study but she did write about it in Nature.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Of course, much has changed since this study took place in 2021. Today, nearly everyone has some immunity to the virus. That\u2019s because most people have had COVID-19, a vaccine against it or both. So our immune responses today would likely differ from those seen in the study, Iwasaki says.",
            "Also of note, the study was pretty small. A larger, more diverse group of people might show a broader range of immune responses.",
            "For whatever reason, those in this study who were able to mount a quick immune response seemed to avoid getting sick. Says Hollenbach, \u201cIt\u2019s a lucky break for those people.\u201d",
            "Now that nearly everyone has some immunity to COVID-19, it will be much harder to do similar studies. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this study so unique,\u201d says Lindeboom. \u201cWe\u2019ll hopefully never be in the position to do this kind of study for SARS-CoV-2 again.\u201d"

            "In response to what she learned, the teen created her first version of TurmBand in 2022. She showcased it at ISEF that year in Atlanta, Ga. Her prototype was made of organic cotton cloth. It contained a padded area smeared with turmeric and shea butter to help the spice stick. Hook-and-loop tape sealed the bandage shut.",
            "But after that competition, Ishita turned up a research paper on turmeric\u2019s color-changing ability. It described how pH affected the spice\u2019s color \u2014 and that this might be a way to highlight the freshness of packaged foods. Ishita also knew that the pH of a wound tends to rise when it becomes infected. She thought these two turmeric traits could be combined to make a smarter bandage.",
            "\u201cBut [that paper] didn\u2019t specifically say what pH it changes [color] at,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I needed to find that on my own.\u201d",
            "Ishita tested 10 liquids at pH levels ranging from 1 to 13 (on the 14-point scale). Acidic liquids are below 7 (such as hydrochloric acid, with a pH of 1\u00a0). Solutions above 7 are basic, such as bleach (with a pH of 11 to 13\u00a0).",
            "The teen poured 0.5 milliliters (0.1 teaspoon) of each liquid into its own well (depression) in a clear tray. Then, she added equal amounts of turmeric to each well.

            "She then tested her mix of turmeric and shea butter on three potential bandage materials. One was organic cotton cloth. She also used gauze. The third was a store-bought adhesive bandage. To simulate an infected wound, she added some sodium bicarbonate\u00a0(NaHCO3) to the mix on each bandage. Also known as baking soda, this has a pH of 9.",
            "Ishita snapped photos for color analysis after 30 seconds. She took more photos three days later. That\u2019s because common symptoms of wound infection, such as redness and pus, usually emerge two or three days after the initial infection, the teen says.\u00a0",
            "Using the color-analyzing software, Ishita found that her infected-wound simulation worked well on all three potential bandage materials. The color change showed up on organic cotton as clearly as on store-bought plastic-based bandages.",

            "TurmBand isn\u2019t just a \u201cgreener\u201d way to heal wounds and warn of infection, the teen says. It\u2019s also cost-effective. Each bandage cost her about $0.44 to make. Store-bought plastic bandages, in contrast, cost almost twice as much \u2014 and don\u2019t highlight infections, Ishita notes. And applying an antibiotic ointment to the wound would add another $1.16, she estimates. That total price of $1.97 could start to approach five times the cost of TurmBand.",
            "Ishita has now developed a second prototype of TurmBand. It uses removable turmeric-infused pads made of organic cotton cloth. Its outer cloth band can be washed and reused over and over. The teen hopes to patent her bandage in the future. Watch a video of her describing her new work here.",

            "AI Scientist is based on a large language model (LLM). Using a paper that describes a machine learning algorithm as template, it starts from searching the literature for similar work. The team then employed the technique called evolutionary computation, which is inspired by the mutations and natural selection of Darwinian evolution. It proceeds in steps, applying small, random changes to an algorithm and selecting the ones that provide an improvement in efficiency.",
            "To do so, AI Scientist conducts its own \u2018experiments\u2019 by running the algorithms and measuring how they perform. At the end, it produces a paper, and evaluates it in a sort of automated peer review. After \u2018augmenting the literature\u2019 this way, the algorithm can then start the cycle again, building on its own results.",
            "The authors admit that the papers AI Scientists produced contained only incremental developments. Some other researchers were scathing in their comments on social media. \u201cAs an editor of a journal, I would likely desk-reject them. As a reviewer, I would reject them,\u201d said one commenter on the website Hacker News.",
            "West also says that the authors took a reductive view of how researchers learn about the current state of their field. A lot of what they know comes from other forms of communication, such as going to conferences or chatting to colleagues at the water cooler. \u201cScience is more than a pile of papers,\u201d says West. \u201cYou can have a 5-minute conversation that will be better than a 5-hour study of the literature.\u201d",
            "West\u2019s colleague Shahan Memon agrees \u2014 but both West and Memon praise the authors for having made their code and results fully open. This has enabled them to analyze the AI Scientist\u2019s results. They\u2019ve found, for example, that it has a \u201cpopularity bias\u201d in the choice of earlier papers it lists as references, skirting towards those with high citation counts. Memon and West say they are also looking into measuring whether AI Scientist\u2019s choices were the most relevant ones.",
            "h2Repetitive tasks",
            "AI Scientist is, of course, not the first attempt at automating at least various parts of the job of a researcher: the dream of automating scientific discovery is as old as artificial intelligence itself \u2014 dating back to the 1950s, says Tom Hope, a computer scientist at the Allen Institute for AI based in Jerusalem. Already a decade ago, for example, the Automatic Statistician2 was able to analyse sets of data and write up its own papers. And Ceder and his colleagues have even automated some bench work: the \u2018robot chemist\u2019 they unveiled last year can synthesize new materials and experiment with them3.",
            "Hope says that current LLMs \u201care not able to formulate novel and useful scientific directions beyond basic superficial combinations of buzzwords\u201d. Still, Ceder says that even if AI won\u2019t able to do the more creative part of the work any time soon, it could still automate a lot of the more repetitive aspects of research. \u201cAt the low level, you\u2019re trying to analyse what something is, how something responds. That\u2019s not the creative part of science, but it\u2019s 90% of what we do.\u201d Lu says he got a similar feedback from a lot of other researchers, too. \u201cPeople will say, I have 100 ideas that I don\u2019t have time for. Get the AI Scientist to do those.\u201d",
            "Lu says that to broaden AI Scientist\u2019s capabilities \u2014 even to abstract fields beyond machine learning, such as pure mathematics \u2014 it might need to include other techniques beyond language models. Recent results on solving maths problems by Google Deep Mind, for example, have shown the power of combining LLMs with techniques of \u2018symbolic\u2019 AI, which build logical rules into a system rather than merely relying on it learning from statistical patterns in data. But the current iteration is but a start, he says. \u201cWe really believe this is the GPT-1 of AI science,\u201d he says, referring to an early large language model by OpenAI in San Francisco, California.",
            "The results feed into a debate that is at the top of many researchers\u2019 concerns these days, says West. \u201cAll my colleagues in different sciences are trying to figure out, where does AI fit in in what we do? It does force us to think what is science in the twenty-first century \u2014 what it could be, what it is, what it is not,\u201d he says.",

            "Monkeypox virus particles (shown in this coloured electron micrograph) can spread through close contact with people and animals.Credit: NIAID/Science Photo Library",
            "When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public-health emergency over mpox earlier this month, it was because a concerning form of the virus that causes the disease had spread to multiple African countries where it had never been seen before. Since then, two people travelling to Africa \u2014 one from Sweden and one from Thailand \u2014 have become infected with that type of virus, called clade 1b, and brought it back to their countries.",
            "\n\nMonkeypox virus: dangerous strain gains ability to spread through sex, new data suggest\n",
            "Although researchers have known about the current outbreak since late last year, the need for answers about it is now more pressing than ever. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has spent decades grappling with monkeypox clade I virus \u2014 a lineage to which Ib belongs. But in the past, clade I infections usually arose when a person came into contact with wild animals, and outbreaks would fizzle.",
            "Clade Ib seems different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex. Around 18,000 suspected cases of mpox, many of them among children, and at least 600 deaths potentially attributable to the disease have been reported this year in the DRC alone.",
            "How does this emergency compare with one declared in 2022, when mpox cases spread around the globe? How is this virus behaving compared with the version that triggered that outbreak, a type called clade II? And will Africa be able to rein this one in? Nature talks with researchers about information they are rushing to gather.",
            "h2Is clade Ib more deadly than the other virus types?",
            "It\u2019s hard to determine, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. He says that the DRC is experiencing two outbreaks simultaneously. The clade I virus, which has been endemic in forested regions of the DRC for decades, circulates in rural regions where people get it from animals. That clade was renamed Ia after the discovery of clade Ib. Studies in animals suggest that clade I is deadlier than clade II1 \u2014 but Kindrachuk says that it\u2019s hard to speculate on what that means for humans at this point.",
            "Even when not fatal, mpox can trigger fevers, aches and painful fluid-filled skin lesions.",
            "\n\nGrowing mpox outbreak prompts WHO to declare global health emergency\n",
            "Although many reports state that 10% of clade I infections in humans are fatal, infectious-disease researcher Laurens Liesenborghs at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, doubts that this figure is accurate. Even the WHO\u2019s latest estimate of a 3.5% fatality rate for people with mpox in the DRC might be high.",
            "There are many reasons that fatality estimates might be unreliable, Liesenborghs says. For one, surveillance data captures only the most severe cases; many people who are less ill might not seek care at hospitals or through physicians, so their infections go unreported.",
            "Another factor that can confound fatality rates is a secondary health condition. For example, people living with HIV \u2014 who can represent a large proportion of the population in many African countries \u2014 die from mpox at twice the rate of the general population2, especially if their HIV is untreated. And the relatively high death rate among children under age 5 could be partly because of malnutrition, which is common among kids in rural parts of the DRC, Liesenborghs says.",
            "h2Is clade Ib more transmissible than other types?",
            "The clade 1b virus has garnered particular attention because epidemiological data suggest that it transmits more readily between people than previous strains did, including through sexual activity, whereas clade Ia mostly comes from animals. An analysis posted ahead of peer review on the preprint server medRxiv3 shows that clade Ib\u2019s genome contains genetic mutations that seem to have been induced by the human immune system, suggesting that it has been in humans for some time. Clade Ia genomes have fewer of these mutations.",
            "But Liesenborghs says that the mutations and clades might not be the most important factor in understanding how monkeypox virus spreads. Although distinguishing Ia from Ib is useful in tracking the disease, he says, the severity and transmissibility of the disease could be affected more by the region where the virus is circulating and the people there. Clade Ia, for instance, seems to be more common in sparsely populated rural regions where it is less likely to spread far. Clade Ib is cropping up in densely populated areas and spreading more readily.",
            "Jean Nachega, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that scientists don\u2019t understand many aspects of mpox transmission \u2014 they haven\u2019t even determined which animal serves as a reservoir for the virus in the wild, although rodents are able to carry it. \u201cWe have to be very humble,\u201d Nachega says.",
            "h2How effective are vaccines against the clade I virus?",
            "Just as was the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, health experts are looking to vaccines to help curb this mpox outbreak. Although there are no vaccines designed specifically against the monkeypox virus, there are two vaccines proven to ward off a related poxvirus \u2014 the one that causes smallpox. Jynneos, made by biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic in Hellerup, Denmark, contains a type of poxvirus that can\u2019t replicate but can trigger an immune response. LC16m8, made by pharmaceutical company KM Biologics in Kumamoto, Japan, contains a live \u2014 but weakened \u2014 version of a different poxvirus strain.",
            "\n\nHopes dashed for drug aimed at monkeypox virus spreading in Africa\n",
            "Still, it\u2019s unclear how effective these smallpox vaccines are against mpox generally. Dimie Ogoina, an infectious-disease specialist at Niger Delta University in Wilberforce Island, Nigeria, points out that vaccines have been tested only against clade II virus in European and US populations, because these shots were distributed by wealthy nations during the 2022 global outbreak. And those recipients were primarily young, healthy men who have sex with men, a population that was particularly susceptible during that outbreak. One study in the United States found that one dose of Jynneos was 80% effective at preventing the disease in at-risk people, whereas two doses were 82% effective4; the WHO recommends getting both jabs.",
            "People in Africa infected with either the clade Ia or 1b virus \u2014 especially children and those with compromised immune systems \u2014 might respond differently. However, one study in the DRC found that the Jynneos vaccine generally raised antibodies against mpox in about 1,000 health-care workers who received it5.",
            "But researchers are trying to fill in some data gaps. A team in the DRC is about to launch a clinical trial of Jynneos in people who have come into close contact with the monkeypox virus \u2014 but have not shown symptoms \u2014 to see whether it can prevent future infection, or improve outcomes if an infection arises.",
            "h2Will the vaccines help to rein in the latest outbreak?",
            "Mpox vaccines have been largely unavailable in Africa, but several wealthy countries have pledged to donate doses to the DRC and other affected African nations. The United States has offered 50,000 Jynneos doses from its national stockpile, and the European Union has ordered 175,000, with individual member countries pledging extra doses. Bavarian Nordic has also added another 40,000. Japan has offered 3.5 million doses of LC16m8 \u2014 for which only one jab is recommended instead of two.",
            "\n\nMonkeypox in Africa: the science the world ignored\n",
            "None of them have arrived yet, though, says Espoir Bwenge Malembaka, an epidemiologist at the Catholic University of Bukavu in the DRC. Low- and middle-income nations cannot receive vaccines until the WHO has deemed the jabs safe and effective. And the WHO has not given its thumbs up yet. It is evaluating data from vaccine manufacturers, delaying donors\u2019 ability to send the vaccines.",
            "Even when the vaccines arrive, Bwenge Malembaka says, \u201cit\u2019s really a drop in the bucket\u201d. The African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, estimates that 10 million doses are needed to rein in the outbreak.",
            "Bwenge Malembaka says that the uncertainty over vaccine arrival has made it difficult for the government to form a distribution plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how one can go about this kind of challenge,\u201d he says. Bwenge Malembaka suspects that children are likely to receive doses first, because they are highly vulnerable to clade I, but officials haven\u2019t decided which regions to target. It\u2019s also unclear how the government would prioritize other vulnerable populations such as sex workers, who have been affected by clade Ib. Their profession is criminalized in the DRC, so they might not be able to come forward for treatment.",
            "Researchers lament that public-health organizations didn\u2019t provide vaccines and other resources as soon as the clade I outbreak was identified, especially given lessons learnt from the 2022 global mpox outbreak. \u201cThe opportunity was there a couple months ago to cut this transmission chain, but resources weren\u2019t available,\u201d Liesenborghs says. \u201cNow, it will be more challenging to tackle this outbreak, and the population at risk is much broader.\u201d",

            "In theory, meta-analyses or systematic reviews should be withdrawn or corrected if work they have cited goes on to be retracted, according to a policy issued in 2021 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international group known for its gold-standard reviews of medical treatments.",
            "Boutron, who directs Cochrane France in Paris, is using Cabanac\u2019s tool to identify systematic reviews that cite retracted work, and to assess the impact the retracted studies had on the overall results.",
            "However, a 2022 study11 suggests that authors are often reluctant to update reviews, even when they are told the papers cite retracted work. Researchers e-mailed the authors of 88 systematic reviews that cited now-retracted studies in bone health by a Japanese fraudster, Yoshihiro Sato. Only 11 of the reviews were updated, the authors told Nature last year.",

            "Authors aren\u2019t routinely alerted if work cited in their past papers is withdrawn \u2014 although in recent years, paper-management tools for researchers such as Zotero and EndNote have incorporated Retraction Watch\u2019s open database of retracted papers and have begun to flag papers that have been taken down. Cabanac thinks publishers might use tools like his to create similar alerts.",
            "In 2016, researchers at the University of Oxford, UK, began developing a tool called RetractoBot, which automatically notifies authors by e-mail when a study that they have previously cited has been retracted. The software currently monitors 20,000 retracted papers and about 400,000 papers, published after 2000, that cite them. The team behind it is running a randomized trial to see whether papers flagged by RetractoBot are subsequently cited less than those not flagged by the tool, and will publish its results next year, says project lead Nicholas DeVito, a integrity researcher at Oxford.",

Of the 5,306 participants, some were healthy, some had Alzheimer\u2019s disease or another form of dementia and some had mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia.",

For example, lower-income nations might have had older equipment that generated lower-quality data than those from higher-income nations. But Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez found no association between lower data quality and either a larger brain-age gap or higher structural inequality.",
            "Now, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez\u2019s team is investigating whether brain-age gaps are linked to national income by comparing brain-age gaps in groups from Asian nations and the United States, and adding data from \u2018epigenetic\u2019 clocks that measure biological age by examining chemical modifications on DNA.

            "Hefei, China",
            "On a cold February morning in Hefei, the snow-blanketed grounds of the Chinese Academy of Science\u2019s Institute of Plasma Physics (ASIPP) are unusually quiet. China\u2019s New Year is approaching, and most people in the city are preparing for days of dragon-themed celebrations. But inside the institute, researchers are still hard at work. In a vast control room under a ceiling studded with red neon-lit stars, plasma physicist Xianzu Gong is taming a different kind of fiery beast.",
            "Gong\u2019s dragon is a fusion research reactor: the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). Tokamaks are doughnut-shaped machines that generate the same nuclear reactions that power the stars. They use magnetic fields to confine heated loops of plasma \u2014 a fluid-like state of matter containing ions and electrons \u2014 at temperatures hotter than the Sun\u2019s core. The aim is to force atomic nuclei to fuse, releasing energy. This could be harnessed as a source of almost limitless clean power, if the scorching, unstable plasma can be maintained and controlled for long enough \u2014 a feat yet to be accomplished.",
            "Corralling the unruly plasma is gruelling work. Every day, Gong and his colleagues fire up around 100 shots of plasma from early morning until around midnight. By comparison, the Joint European Torus (JET) in Culham, UK, which was the world\u2019s largest fusion-research facility before it closed last year, achieved 20\u201330 shots each day. \u201cAlmost no weekends, no holidays for us,\u201d says Gong, who heads EAST\u2019s physics and experimental operations.",

            "Although only a stepping stone to anticipated fusion power plants, EAST is one of the facilities that\u2019s putting China on the map in the global race for nuclear fusion.",
            "The world\u2019s most well-known fusion experiment is the US$22-billion International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a giant tokamak being constructed in southern France, to which China is contributing. And in recent years, ambitious firms in the United States and elsewhere have raised billions of dollars to build their own reactors, which they say will demonstrate practical fusion power before state-led programmes do.",
            "\n\nThe chase for fusion energy\n",
            "At the same time, China is fast pouring resources into its fusion efforts. The Chinese government\u2019s current five-year plan makes comprehensive research facilities for crucial fusion projects a major priority for the country\u2019s national science and technology infrastructure. As a rough estimate, China could now be spending $1.5 billion each year on fusion \u2014 almost double what the US government allocated this year for this research, says Jean Paul Allain, associate director of the US Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Fusion Energy Sciences in Washington DC. \u201cEven more important than the total value is the speed at which they\u2019re doing it,\u201d says Allain.",
            "\u201cChina has built itself up from being a non-player 25 years ago to having world-class capabilities,\u201d says Dennis Whyte, a nuclear scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge.",
            "Although no one yet knows whether fusion power plants are possible, Chinese scientists have ambitious timelines. In the 2030s, before ITER will have begun its main experiments, the country aims to build the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR), with the goal of producing up to 1 gigawatt of fusion power. If China\u2019s plans work out, a prototype fusion power plant could follow in the next few decades, according to a 2022 road map (J. Zheng et al. The Innovation 3, 100269; 2022).",
            "\u201cChina is taking a strategic approach to invest in and develop its fusion energy programme, with a view of long-term leadership in the global field,\u201d says Yasmin Andrew, a plasma physicist at Imperial College London.",
            "h2Building artificial suns",
            "Scientists have been trying to make fusion reactors work since the 1950s. The idea is to merge two hydrogen nuclei \u2014 which are positively charged and therefore repel each other \u2014 into a larger helium one. In the Sun, gravity generates enough pressure to do this; on Earth, high temperatures and strong magnetic fields are necessary. So far, however, researchers haven\u2019t been able to keep fusion reactions running long enough to produce more energy than it takes to spark them.",
            "In late 2022, researchers at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California, announced a breakthrough when they briefly recovered more fusion energy than they put into their fuel. Using an alternative design to a tokamak, NIF fired 192 laser beams at a tiny pellet of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, causing them to fuse. However, much more energy went into operating the lasers than was delivered to the target. Many researchers say the most practical approach to fusion energy will entail using a tokamak to confine a long-lived \u2018burning plasma\u2019, one in which the fusion reactions provide the heat needed to sustain it. One of ITER\u2019s targets, seen as a general prerequisite for viable fusion plants, is to create a burning plasma that produces ten times the power that went into it.",

            "If scientists can do this, fusion could offer a safer, cleaner alternative to conventional nuclear-fission power plants that split heavy uranium nuclei, producing radioactive waste that can remain dangerous for thousands of years. Fusion reactors would produce only short-lived waste. Another safety feature is that fusion reactions simply stop if the plasma falls below a certain temperature or density. And the process is expected to be more efficient than fission; the International Atomic Energy Agency says that fusion could generate four times more energy than does fission, per kilogram of fuel.",
            "It\u2019s a particularly tantalizing prospect for China where, between 2020 and 2022, several regions experienced massive power outages owing to skyrocketing demand for electricity during frigid winters. Despite rapid progress in renewable energy, the country still generates more than half of its electricity from coal and remains the biggest contributor to global carbon emissions. And although China is aiming to achieve peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, its energy requirements are set to double over the next three decades. \u201cWe need innovations that reduce carbon \u2014 that\u2019s our dream. Nuclear fusion energy can do this,\u201d says plasma physicist Yuntao Song, ASIPP\u2019s director-general.",

The plasma itself lies behind the control room\u2019s wall of monitors, confined in a vacuum chamber that has the Chinese flag mounted on its roof. \u201cEvery shot could be in support for the future of fusion energy,\u201d Gong says.",
            "China\u2019s involvement in fusion began with building several small and medium-sized tokamaks using components from devices in Russia and Germany. In 2003, it joined the international ITER experiment, alongside the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States.",

            "In 2006, China opened EAST, which has since racked up world records for sustaining plasma lasting minutes, instead of seconds. EAST\u2019s knack for creating long-lived plasmas has made it an experimental workhorse for ITER, particularly for quickly cross-checking results, says Alberto Loarte, who heads ITER\u2019s science division. \u201cThe research in China is extremely dynamic,\u201d he says.",
            "Loarte cites how, this January, he and his colleagues spent a week running experiments at EAST, to verify that lining a reactor\u2019s plasma-facing walls with tungsten can achieve a tightly confined plasma, even if the walls aren\u2019t also coated with a boron layer to keep out impurities. (These findings will help ITER, at which in October 2023 researchers decided to switch wall-linings to tungsten instead of beryllium.) In many countries, such an effort would have taken months to organize, says Loarte. But in China, plans often come together in weeks because many research groups don\u2019t require formal proposals or lengthy discussions to get to work.",
            "ITER originally aimed to start experiments in 2020 but has been plagued by delays. In July, researchers announced that it will push back its major experiments to 2039. Most ITER countries are developing their domestic fusion capabilities in parallel, but few are doing so as intensively as China, says Jeronimo Garcia Olaya, a fusion scientist at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission in Paris. \u201cThey are building a very ambitious programme,\u201d says Olaya, who co-leads experiments at JT-60SA in Naka, Japan, currently the world\u2019s largest tokamak in operation.",
            "Among China\u2019s other research fusion reactors, besides EAST, is its HL-3 tokamak, opened in 2020 at the Southwestern Institute of Physics in Chengdu. Experiments at China\u2019s facilities will feed into the next-generation CFETR, although construction still needs approval from the government. An official at ASIPP who didn\u2019t want to be named couldn\u2019t give a timeline for this, but says that the government is factoring ITER\u2019s timeline into its decision. The CFETR, which will be slightly bigger than ITER, aims to bridge the gap between ITER \u2014 a purely experimental device \u2014 and demonstration plants that would generate electricity.",

            "CFETR first aims to generate between 100 and 200 megawatts of net power: producing more power than went into heating the plasma, but not enough to cover the electricity used to operate the facility. By the 2040s, its goal is to deliver more than ten times as much heat as is directly put into the plasma, the milestone for viable fusion, and also to produce up to a gigawatt of net power. If this could be achieved, demonstration power plants would then produce grid electricity.",
            "\n\nITER delay: what it means for nuclear fusion\n",
            "CFETR\u2019s engineering design report, released in 2022, places the facility ahead of several demonstration power plants, including the European Union\u2019s and Japan\u2019s proposed DEMO reactors \u2014 expected to begin their engineering designs in 2029 and 2025, respectively.",
            "China\u2019s strength in fusion research lies not so much in stand-out engineering innovations, says Allain, as in its speed and focus on developing the materials, components and diagnostics systems needed to build reactors.",
            "To develop CFETR, ASIPP has started building a sprawling 40-hectare workshop (about the size of 60 football fields) a short drive from EAST. Scheduled for completion next year, the Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology (CRAFT) is a massive hub where researchers will develop and manufacture materials, components and prototypes for CFETR and subsequent fusion power plants.",

Allain estimates that China has thousands of PhD students in fusion, compared with mere hundreds in the United States.",
            "h2Commercial efforts",
            "Although China\u2019s programme is ramping up fast, start-up firms around the world make much bolder claims about the pace with which they can commercialize fusion energy.",
            "For example, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a spin-off from MIT, promises that its tokamak, called SPARC, will be the first to churn out more fusion energy than the heat that the plasma consumes. The firm, which is based in Devens, Massachusetts, and is working with MIT researchers, says SPARC will produce its first plasma by the end of 2026. The effort relies on advances in high-temperature superconducting materials, which should allow the tokamak to be much smaller and quicker to build than ITER and other giant facilities. CFS says it will have plants supplying electricity grids by the early 2030s. Other firms are making similarly bullish statements about various designs for pilot fusion plants.",

            "Globally, more than 40 companies are working to commercialize fusion, and together have received investments of $7.1 billion, says the US-based Fusion Industry Association (FIA).",
            "But China\u2019s industrial efforts are burgeoning, too. The country\u2019s fusion start-ups have attracted more than $500 million in investment in just a few years, says Andrew Holland, chief executive of the FIA. That places China second only to the United States, which has poured more than $5 billion into fusion companies. \u201cThe private fusion effort in China is significant,\u201d he says.",
            "In January, the Chinese government launched a national consortium called China Fusion Energy. Led by the China National Nuclear Corporation, it brings together 25 government-owned companies, four universities and a private firm with the goal of pooling resources to accelerate China\u2019s fusion effort.",
            "Among industrial heavyweights in fusion research is the ENN Group, one of China\u2019s biggest private energy conglomerates. According to the FIA, the company has invested more than $200 million in its fusion energy programme. An ENN road map envisages building a \u2018commercial demonstration\u2019 reactor by 2035.",
            "A handful of dedicated fusion companies have sprouted up in China over the past three years. Among them is Energy Singularity, a Shanghai-based start-up founded in 2021 and the country\u2019s first dedicated fusion power firm. Much like SPARC, Energy Singularity aims to build smaller, less expensive tokamaks by taking advantage of the latest materials for magnets; it has so far attracted around $110 million in funding, says co-founder Zhao Yang. In June, the firm\u2019s HH70 tokamak achieved its first plasma and using high-temperature superconducting magnets \u2014 a world first, Yang says.",

            "Energy Singularity is planning a next-generation device, HH170, which aims to produce ten times more energy than the heat needed to fuel the plasma. Just as optimistically as the US firms, Yang estimates that the small tokamak will take only three to four years to build, instead of decades.",
            "One of the big questions in fusion surrounds the availability of fuel. For tokamaks, a mixture of deuterium and tritium (D\u2013T) isotopes is considered one of the most efficient fuels. But tritium occurs in minuscule traces in nature, so will need to be produced in fusion facilities, through a reaction between the neutrons produced during fusion reactions and a blanket of lithium in the tokamak wall. Whether such \u2018tritium breeding\u2019 can actually work is unclear.",
            "ITER is one of the largest research efforts that will explore this question. But China has speedier plans: its Burning Plasma Experimental Tokamak (BEST), built next to CRAFT and due to be completed in 2027, will also run D\u2013T experiments and explore whether tritium can be bred, says ASIPP director Song.",
            "It\u2019s all part of a long-term push to develop what many see as a key solution to the world\u2019s energy problems. Back at EAST, in contrast to the bullish claims of private firms, Gong sees the race for fusion energy more as a marathon than a sprint. He has thousands of plasma shots ahead of him. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work we need to do,\u201d he says.",

So scientists are working hard to develop innovative ways to cool cities and slash electricity use in the warming world. Advances range from high-efficiency air conditioners to special materials that keep surfaces colder than their surroundings without using electricity.",
            "h2Researching refrigeration ",
            "In most air conditioners and refrigerators, a fluid is compressed to transfer heat from inside the room or appliance to outside. But this process emits greenhouse gases and guzzles energy. Globally, air conditioners and electric fans consume about 20% of the electricity used in buildings, according to the International Energy Agency. And the agency predicts that the amount of energy required for air conditioning around the globe will surge threefold by 2050.",
            "With that in mind, many researchers are working to reduce the amount of energy that air conditioners consume. One potential solution emerged last year, when a team of researchers developed a technology that might make the appliances work much more efficiently2. And it has the added benefit of not relying on environmentally damaging liquid coolants.",
            "\n\n\u2018Electrocaloric\u2019 heat pump could transform air conditioning\n",
            "Emmanuel Defay, a researcher at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology in Belvaux, and his colleagues built a device that relies on \u2018electrocaloric\u2019 cooling. In this process, an electric field is applied to change the position of atoms in an insulating ceramic. Because the field constrains the atoms\u2019 movements, their vibrations increase and are converted into heat, raising the temperature of the material. Fluid carries that heat away to the outside. Once the heat has been removed, the field is shut off and the atoms in the ceramic can move more freely. That causes their vibrations to decrease and the ceramic\u2019s temperature drops, a change that can be used for cooling purposes.",
            "The device was designed in collaboration with the Japanese manufacturing company Murata in Nagaokakyo, which already produces these kinds of ceramics for mobile phones, computers and other hardware. That will help to make the technology scalable, says Defay. But he warns that getting it into products might take time. He hopes that he and his team can work on the first niche cases, such as cooling down batteries in electric cars, within five years. Then, perhaps, they can tackle air conditioning in the next decade.",
            "h2Game-changing materials",
            "Other components \u2014 known as supercool materials \u2014 might be able to lower temperatures below ambient conditions without power.",
            "All materials reflect some portion of the sunlight that hits them, and all emit energy as heat. But supercool materials do both extremely well \u2014 reflecting most of their incident solar radiation and emitting a lot of their thermal radiation. That makes them cooler than their surrounding temperature.",
            "\u201cThese materials are potentially a game-changer,\u201d says David Sailor, director of the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University in Tempe, who doesn\u2019t develop these technologies but studies how they could be used in urban environments. Not only can they help to cool a building \u2014 thus reducing the demand for air conditioning \u2014 but they can also cool the outdoor air. \u201cIf a surface is always cooler than the air, then that surface is always taking heat out of the air as the air flows over it,\u201d Sailor says. \u201cSo it\u2019s actively cooling the urban atmosphere.\u201d",
            "The first supercool material was designed in 2014 when Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist now at the University of California, Los Angeles, was conducting research at Stanford University, also in California. He and his colleagues created a cooling surface that was highly reflective at the visible wavelengths where the Sun\u2019s radiation peaks, and emissive in the mid-infrared3. The latter was key. The atmosphere traps most of the infrared radiation emitted as heat by objects on Earth\u2019s surface. But a specific band of infrared, with wavelengths of 8\u201313 micrometres, passes straight through the atmosphere and disappears into space. Supercool materials exploit that infrared window.",
            "Mounted on a roof, Raman\u2019s technology \u2014 which was made of seven alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium dioxide \u2014 stayed 5\u2009\u00b0C cooler than the ambient air temperature.",

            "Since then, the field has exploded. In the laboratory, supercool materials have been built in the form of plastics, metals, paints and even wood.",
            "And scientists are continuing to push them further. In July, researchers at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, reported that they had freeze-dried a solution of commercially obtained salmon sperm DNA and gelatin to create a supercool aerogel4. When placed outside, the aerogel cooled surfaces to up to 16\u2009\u00b0C below the ambient air temperature.",
            "Xianhu Liu, a materials scientist at Zhengzhou University in China, who was not involved in the study, is particularly excited that the material uses less energy and reduces pollutants compared with other supercool materials that use additives, such as metal oxide nanoparticles. The fact that this work used biomass materials also means it\u2019s degradable. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare combination of sustainability and energy efficiency,\u201d Liu says.",
            "But Raman doubts the accuracy of the study\u2019s results. The team measured an air temperature 20\u201330\u2009\u00b0C higher than that reported by weather stations for that day and location. \u201cIt seems likely that their temperature sensor was exposed to the Sun and heated up,\u201d Raman says.",
            "However, Jian-Wen Ma, the study\u2019s lead researcher, says that he and his team measured the air temperature inside a closed cooling test box, not the external atmospheric temperature4. \u201cThere is ongoing debate about cooling test methods,\u201d he says. \u201cThe characterization of radiative cooling remains complex and imperfect, and we hope for a unified standard in the future.\u201d",
            "h2Cool surfaces",
            "In his own research, Raman has moved from supercool materials to a category called cool materials, which are typically engineered to reflect most of their incident solar radiation, but not necessarily tailored to emit most of their thermal radiation.",
            "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this fancy thing in the infrared, you just need to make it really solar reflective,\u201d he says. That\u2019s because most materials will still emit heat across the entire infrared spectrum and will reach temperatures slightly below those of ambient air if they are reflective enough, Raman says.",
            "Raman has also been working on another type of material for vertical surfaces such as building facades. This is a difficult application because walls face both the sky and the ground, so they absorb heat from Earth during the summer and lose heat to it during the winter.",
            "\n\nThe supercool materials that send heat to space\n",
            "Raman\u2019s team found a potential solution. In June, the researchers reported a physical mechanism that relies on a special material to cool or warm walls depending on the season5. The coating achieves this by selectively losing heat towards the sky and gaining much less heat from the ground in the summer. And in the winter, it loses less heat to the ground than a conventional wall does. To boot, the team has found that many low-cost materials have this unique property \u2014 including the polypropylene bags used for crisps, or potato chips. The discovery could be a boon for places that don\u2019t have air conditioning, and could improve thermal comfort and even human health, he says.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t want to advance the perception, especially among architects and engineers, that this is some faraway thing,\u201d Raman says. \u201cI want them to realize there\u2019s a lot of things we can do right away.\u201d",
            "Other researchers are also working on this problem. A report this month by Yuan Yang, a materials scientist at Columbia University in New York City, and his colleagues describes work in which they applied a supercool paint to a corrugated wall \u2014 but only to the sides of the wave-like pattern that face the sky. The team then applied a metal that has a low heat absorption to the side facing the ground, ensuring that side did not take up excess heat6. The surface temperature of the wall stayed 2\u20133\u2009\u00b0C cooler than the ambient air temperature. The team is currently looking for funding to support further development.",
            "Other technologies are attempting to cool cities from the ground up. Last September, a team at Arizona State University in Tempe, led by Sailor, partnered with a US company that managed a large shopping centre to deploy and test a reflective \u2018cool pavement\u2019. The highly reflective coating is simply a lighter-coloured, asphalt-based seal that can be used instead of the conventional dark coating that is applied every five years or so to maintain the surface. As a test run, the lighter seal was applied to almost 6,000 square metres of the centre\u2019s car park, and the surrounding area was coated with a conventional dark seal \u2014 allowing Sailor and his team to compare the two.",
            "The difference was like night and day. In the early afternoon, the surface temperature of the cool pavement was almost 8\u2009\u00b0C cooler than the rest of the car park, and the air temperature above it was 0.8\u2009\u00b0C cooler, says Sailor, who has not yet published this finding.",
            "Although the latter figure might not seem a noteworthy change, Sailor argues that if you could cool the entire city of Phoenix in Arizona by 0.6\u2009\u00b0C, you would reduce energy consumption and water use and even improve human health outcomes. Sailor estimated that the drop in air conditioning alone would save around US$20 million.",
            "h2Shape-shifting materials ",
            "Mohammad Taha, an engineer at the University of Melbourne in Australia, and their team are taking a different approach to cool homes and buildings. Early in 2023, the team described \u2018phase-change inks\u2019 consisting of suspended nanoparticles that change phase depending on the temperature, shifting from a superconductor at cool temperatures to a metal at hotter temperatures7.",
            "\n\nHow heat from the Sun can keep us all cool\n",
            "That trick allows the material to stay cool or warm, depending on the external temperature. In short, when the material heats up and becomes a metal, it adopts a linear structure that can reflect extra heat. When it cools and becomes a superconductor, the material adopts an insulating zig-zag structure that allows heat in.",
            "In the future, Taha hopes to apply this ink as a window coating. \u201cIf you look at the weakest link in a building in terms of heat loss, it\u2019s the windows,\u201d they say. \u201cA building that\u2019s entirely glass can actually feel like a greenhouse on a hot day.\u201d That could change if Taha and their team can apply this ink to windows effectively in the future. Moreover, the researchers can engineer different coatings depending on the season \u2014 layering them to keep a building cool during summer and warm during winter.",
            "h2From lab to cities",
            "It\u2019s not yet clear which of these cooling technologies are likely to have a big impact in future. Many have not left the lab and others have been deployed only in small-scale projects. For that reason, Sailor argues that researchers need to evaluate all new materials carefully before moving forward. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we in the science community \u2014 and I take this as one of my responsibilities in evaluating these technologies \u2014 focus not just on their strengths, but also on their weaknesses,\u201d he says.",
            "The cool pavement, for example, has a potential drawback in that it reflects radiation upwards. Someone on that pavement when the Sun is high in the sky will feel the reflected radiation from below in addition to that from above. He suggests that the coating would be less suitable in areas such as playgrounds, where individuals might spend a long time on the surface in the middle of the day. A better option would be to use it on street pedestrian crossings, where individuals spend mere seconds, he says.",
            "There are also questions about how well supercool materials will work in a wide variety of climates. If it is cloudy or humid, for example, such materials might be less effective \u2014 that\u2019s because water vapour traps the infrared radiation, stopping it from escaping into space8. Raman, however, argues that supercool materials can still perform well in these climates. Even if they can\u2019t cool the air temperature sufficiently, he says, they won\u2019t heat it up either9.",
            "Another unknown is whether consumers will embrace the idea. Even the simple measure of replacing old roofs with lighter, reflective ones has not been widely adopted. As part of his work, Sailor routinely takes an infrared camera up in a helicopter over Phoenix and is always amazed by the number of dark rooftops \u2014 despite the benefits of cooler, lighter roofs.",
            "Nonetheless, several cities are testing and deploying various mitigation technologies. Los Angeles, for example, has been adding cool pavements with the goal of increasing cool surfaces there by 30% by 2045.",
            "Mattheos Santamouris, a physicist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, and his team have applied similar materials in more than 300 large-scale mitigation projects across the world. In January, his group detailed a multifaceted strategy to cool Riyadh by up to 4.5\u2009\u00b0C10. \u201cThis is really the champion of the mitigation projects,\u201d Santamouris says. The recommended approach, which Riyadh has started adopting, includes retrofitting buildings with both cool and supercool materials, and doubling the number of irrigated trees.",
            "Although the approach includes a suite of solutions, Santamouris\u2019s team calculated that the addition of supercool materials will have the biggest impact. \u201cThe market is increasing tremendously,\u201d Santamouris says about these materials. \u201cThere are more and more industrial producers around the world. I think that this is the future.\u201d",

Their study, published in Science today, found that policies that combine several tools are more effective in slashing emissions than are stand-alone measures1.",
            "The analysis identified 63 interventions in 35 countries that led to significant reductions in emissions, cutting them by 19% on average. Most reductions were linked to two or more policies. Together, the 63 policies cut emissions by between 0.6 and 1.8 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent.",

            "Using the right mix of policies is more important than using a lot of policies, says Annika Stechemesser, a co-author and researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s phasing out of coal-fired power stations worked because it was used in tandem with pricing mechanisms, such as a minimum carbon price; in Norway, banning combustion engine cars was most effective when combined with a price incentive that made electric cars cheaper.",
            "\u201cTo my knowledge, it is a first-of-its-kind study providing such a global evaluation,\u201d says Jan Minx, an environmental economist with the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin.",
            "h2Road to reductions",
            "As part of the analysis, Stechemesser and her colleagues used a database of 1,500 climate policies implemented between 1998 and 2022 in 41 countries, including the top three greenhouse gas emitters globally: China, the United States and India. The policies fell into 48 categories, ranging from emission trading schemes to fossil-fuel subsidy reforms.",
            "\u201cPrevious evaluations have typically concentrated on a narrow set of prominent policies in selected countries, overlooking the hundreds of other measures,\u201d Stechemesser says.",
            "The authors combined machine learning with a statistical analytical approach to identify large emission reductions in four high-emitting sectors \u2014 buildings, electricity, industry and transport. They compared the results with policies in the database to assess which policies and policy combinations led to the biggest emission drops.",
            "\u201cThis is a rather clever method,\u201d says Zheng Saina, who has analysed global climate policies at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. The conventional way would have been to review the large number of policies and select the important ones, but that approach is subjective and cumbersome, she adds. \u201cThe authors instead used machine learning to detect major emissions changes. It is more objective.\u201d",
            "h2Right mix",
            "The results showed that certain policy combinations worked better in specific sectors and economies. In terms of reducing emissions associated with electricity generation, for instance, pricing interventions such as energy taxes were particularly effective in high-income countries, but less so in lower-and-middle income countries.",
            "In the building sector, policy mixes that included phased-out and banned emissions-generating activities more than doubled the reductions resulting from implementing those policies individually.",
            "Taxation was the only policy that achieved nearly equal or larger emission reductions as a stand-alone policy, as opposed to a policy mix, in all four sectors.",
            "Minx says the study\u2019s AI-enhanced approach allowed the researchers, for the first time, to evaluate the effectiveness of a large number of climate policies from a global set of emission inventories covering different countries and sectors.",
            "For other researchers, the paper is alarming. \u201cThis study provides a warning to countries around the world that their climate policies have had very limited effects so far,\u201d says Xu Chi, an ecologist at Nanjing University. \u201cExisting polices will need to be re-evaluated, and changes will need to be made,\u201d Xu adds.",
            "The world\u2019s annual emissions are projected to be 15 Gt of CO2 equivalents higher by 2030 than would be required to keep global warming to less than 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, according to the United Nations.",

In May, devastating floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul uncovered pieces of bone from at least 35 ancient animals, including a 233-million-year-old skeleton that is among the oldest dinosaur fossils in the world. But intermittent rain showers and wet conditions since then have researchers racing to recover other smaller, more-vulnerable specimens that are also precious.",

They would eventually be replaced during the Jurassic period (200 million to 145 million years ago) by larger dinosaurs called theropods, which include bipedal, three-toed meat-eaters such as Tyrannosaurus rex.",
            "Some researchers argue that the herrerasaurids were the first theropods, but this designation is still controversial. \u201cThis is why the findings of CAPPA are so important \u2014 they can help us solve open questions like this,\u201d Ghilardi says.",

            "You are what you eat \u2014 at least when it comes to the microbiome. A catalogue of microorganisms from more than 2,500 cheeses, meats and other foods suggests that a small portion of each person\u2019s microbiome comes from the food they eat. The study1 is the largest-ever compendium of bacteria, fungi and other microbes found in foods.",
            "Some microbes are an essential ingredient of fermented foods \u2014 from salami to sauerkraut and kimchi to kefir. Other microorganisms in fermented and unfermented foods could be important to their taste and other properties such as how quickly they spoil, says microbiologist Nicola Segata at the University of Trento, Italy, who co-led the work, published in Cell on 29 August.",
            "h2Fermented foods",
            "Segata and his colleagues sequenced microbial DNA from nearly 2,000 foods and collated these data with almost 600 existing food microbiomes. Most of the foods were fermented \u2014 Segata was sure to include samples of Gorgonzola cheese, one of his favourites \u2014 but the study also included fresh meat, fish, fruit and vegetables.",
            "Similar foods tended to harbour similar microbes, although a closer look revealed some intriguing patterns. Lactic acid-making bacteria including Lactobacillus were especially prevalent in dairy products, but the composition varied. Dutch blue cheese harboured different Lactobacillus species from Italian fontina and mozzarella, for instance. Microbes from coffee, kombucha and pu\u2019er \u2014 a fermented tea from Yunnan, China \u2014 resembled those in alcoholic beverages.",
            "Nearly every microbiome study uncovers organisms that have never been seen before, and this one was no different. About half the microbes the researchers identified were new. Pulque \u2014 a sour agave wine drunk in Mexico \u2014 was especially rich in this microbial dark matter, as were African palm wine and cheese brine.",
            "h2Microbe overlap",
            "When the researchers compared the food microbiomes with thousands of microbiomes from human guts and mouths, they found a degree of overlap. About 3% of the microbe species in adults\u2019 guts, 8% of children\u2019s and more than 50% of newborns\u2019 were also found in food. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that these microbes all came from foods people ate, Segata says: the overlap could also reflect instances in the past when food microbes became established in peoples\u2019 guts and began circulating between humans. The food microbes in newborns\u2019 microbiomes tended to be associated with dairy but are also found in breast milk.",
            "None of these findings is especially surprising, says Benjamin Wolfe, a microbiologist at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. But the study lays the groundwork for detailed research into why various microbes \u2014 and communities of microbes \u2014 are in particular foods. He\u2019s also intrigued by all the unknown microbes in what we eat. Mining these, Wolfe says, could lead to new kinds of food with novel properties.",

            "In humans, the largest declines in grey matter in the brain \u2014 a sign of ageing \u2014 occurred in the frontal cortex.Credit: Samunella/Science Photo Library",
            "In the more than six million years since people and chimpanzees split from their common ancestor, human brains have rapidly amassed tissue that helps decision-making and self-control. But the same regions are also the most at risk of deterioration during ageing, finds a study1 that compared images of chimp brains with scans of human brains.",
            "Previous studies have shown that regions of the human brain that are the last to mature, such as parts of the frontal lobe, are the first to show signs of ageing2, a theory known as \u2018last in, first out\u2019. The latest study shows that some of those regions that mature later, and are most susceptible to ageing, also evolved most recently in humans.",
            "The results tend to support the \u201cimportant hypothesis that our cortical expansion came at the price of age-related decline\u201d, says Rogier Mars, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK. The results were published in Science Advances on 28 August.",
            "h2Mind maps",
            "Researchers created data-driven maps of human and chimp (Pan troglodytes) brains using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They analysed scans from 189 chimps between the ages of 9 and 50, and 480 people between the ages of 20 and 74.",
            "Overall, they found that the brains of the two species were generally symmetrical across both hemispheres and had many similar clusters of anatomical structures, especially in areas of the prefrontal cortex. This region is involved in complex cognitive functions, such as language, working memory, time perception and decision-making, says study co-author Felix Hoffstaedter, a big-data neuroscientist at the Research Centre J\u00fclich, who is based in Bonn, Germany. Damage to this region is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and several types of dementia, he says.",
            "The researchers then measured how much grey matter in the brain shrank over time \u2014 a sign of ageing \u2014 in chimps up to the age of 50, and in humans up to the equivalent age of 58. In humans, they found the largest declines in the frontal cortex, including the prefrontal cortex, whereas chimps experienced the largest declines in a central structure involved in habit-forming and reward behaviours, called the striatum. Regions of the brain involved with visual processing and motor skills were less susceptible to ageing in both species.",
            "h2Rapid growth",
            "Finally, the researchers assessed which regions of the human brain had expanded most compared with the chimp brain and compared scans of human and chimp brains of equivalent age and sex. The speediest evolutionary growth had occurred in areas of the prefrontal cortex \u2014 one of the regions most susceptible to ageing. A structure hidden deep in the brain and involved in processing emotions and bodily signals, called the insula, also showed rapid evolutionary growth and increased risk from ageing.",
            "\u201cEvolutionarily, the latest, greatest changes\u201d, says Hoffstaedter, are \u201cwhere the ageing is happening the most\u201d.",
            "The researchers also compared chimps with olive baboons (Papio anubis) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Here, they found no such link between the areas of the brain that had experienced rapid evolutionary expansion and those that went through accelerated ageing, suggesting that this feature could be unique to human brain evolution.",
            "Mars says it would be interesting to look at age-related changes beyond grey-matter decline, including changes in the connections between brain regions and gene expression profiles.",
